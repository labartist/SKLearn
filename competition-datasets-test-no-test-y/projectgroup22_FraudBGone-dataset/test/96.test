['5', "I first encountered this album back when I worked at Our Price back in 1989 and was instantly taken by the title and wondered if it was the old Pink Fairies song which was surely a pre-punk classic. Sadly it was bought before I could play it and not reordered for stock. It's taken me until now (almost 30 years) to get it and find out. The wait was worth it! It is the Pink Fairies tune and is coupled with some hi-energy angsty punk ranters. Not for the feint of heart but a blinder none the less.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 8, 52, 57]]
