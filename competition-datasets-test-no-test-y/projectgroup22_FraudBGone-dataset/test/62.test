This review is for the "New Generation Mpow¥Ô iSnap X One-piece U-Shape Self-portrait Monopod Extendable Selfie Stick with built-in Bluetooth Remote Shutter_\x86\x9d This is my first experience with a _\x86_selfie stick._\x86\x9d It came packaged in a simple, elegant, white box. Pairing is simple and painless, and once paired, it has reconnected to my iPhone 6 without any issue. Simply turn it on, and it connects back up to my iPhone 6 automatically. Construction feels very good. The extension pole is stiff and requires a little effort to pull out, but it does not flex under the weight of the iPhone when fully extended. It also does not collapse at all under it_\x86_s own weight when fully extended. The phone is held in by a spring loaded extension bar. Getting an iPhone 6 into it is a little tricky due to the thinness (I carry my iPhone without a case), but very manageable. Once put it, it is held very firmly. I tested it by taking a photo, fully extended, out the top of a Jeep Wrangler with the top down, doing about 50 mph. The iPhone was held in place very well, and I was able to hold it steady enough (even with the wind at 50 mph!) to take some photos (and no, I wasn_\x86_t driving!). Taking photos is easy as well. You just press the camera button on the stick which is conveniently placed where your thumb is while holding the handle. It also works to start and stop a video recording. Overall I give this 5 stars. It is simple to setup and use, feels very sturdy, and is pretty inexpensive. Excellent value for the money.', [0, 0, 0, 0, 134], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7]]
