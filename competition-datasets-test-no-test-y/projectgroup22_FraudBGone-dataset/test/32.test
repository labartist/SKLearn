['5', "I got the 6' usb-c to usb-c for my Google Nexus 6P. This in conjunction with the CHOE USB Type C Harger DOES rapidly charge my Nexus 6P (at least I see no difference between the OEM charger and wire.) Cheap price, but the cable is thick and well constructed definitely NOT flimsy. It's solid and appears to be built to last! Outstanding product!", [0, 0, 0, 0, 144], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4]]
