['5', "These earbuds are an incredible value. I consider myself somewhat of an earbud connisseur. I have Harmon Kardon, Bose, Sony, Skull Candy, Ultimate Ears, Beats, etc. My favorite is the Ultimate Ears, but these are great for the price. I decided to pull the trigger on these because they were so inexpensive, and I'm glad I did. Don't expect studio quality sound or anything with these, but for the price and functionality these are the best value out there.", [0, 0, 1, 3, 209], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7]]
