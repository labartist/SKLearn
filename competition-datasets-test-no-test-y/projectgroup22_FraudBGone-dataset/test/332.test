['4', "I bought the original vinyl when it came out and also went to see the Oz ay Hammersmith Odeon. As a callow youth it was great entertainment but what I remembered was a song he played live that wasn't on the lp. Now much to surprise it's an extra track on the CD allowing me to hear it again for the second time some 35 years later. I remembered the song pretty well and though the version here is not as dynamic it holds up quite well. In fact the whole album does despite my tastes changing a fair bit over the years. I guess a lot of these tracks (Suicide solution being a standout) are pretty iconic.", [0, 0, 1, 5, 41], [0, 0, 8, 52, 57]]
