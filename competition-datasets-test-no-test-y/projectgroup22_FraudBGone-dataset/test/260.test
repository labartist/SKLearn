['5', "I ordered these lights in early February and when they arrived 2 out of the 10 didn't work. After posting a somewhat critical review, I was contacted by email by Garden Joy's customer service representative. She offered to replace the 2 lights that didn't work, plus add a third light, and also offered a full refund. I declined the refund but did ask for the 3 lights. They came within a week and work just fine. I am now very satisfied with the lights and, more to the point, the way this matter was handled by Garden Joy. This matter was handled very professionally and I would order from this company again.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 168], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7]]
