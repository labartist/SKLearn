['5', "A good get if you're looking to find a good pair of wireless earbuds whether for casual listening or while working out in the gym. Just the ear stabilizers are good enough for any strength/weight training and light movement exercises. For running keep the cord from swaying and slipping from the ears by using the clip and ear hooks. So far the charge time lasts around the expected 5 hours; no idea on how long that max charge capacity will remain, obviously will depend on usage and recharge frequency.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 80], [0, 0, 0, 0, 15]]
