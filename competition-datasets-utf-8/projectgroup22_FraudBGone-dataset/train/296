[3, 'This was slightly large, especially under the arms but its. At first my wife didnt feel comfortable wearing it and had to make a slight adjustment to it to stop herself from falling out. She didnt want to send it back because she loves the design and the material is very nice. She says that everywhere else it fits comfortably. Overall she is pleased with it and has worn it in the pool many times during the holiday.', [0, 0, 2, 1, 3], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
