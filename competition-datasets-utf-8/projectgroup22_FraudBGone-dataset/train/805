[5, 'Lovely paper! Great value! Non toxic. Although some of the sheets where little creased form p&p and all of them were folded in half and then half again,  but that was not an issue for me, cause I got them to make pom poms for my sons first Birsay photoshoot. They were just perfect for the job and pom poms looked lovely. Any other occasion and I will be buying it again.', [38, 34, 58, 112, 760], [1, 1, 1, 5, 56]]
