[5, "Usual fare, Dean and Sam against the world, Hell and a host of Angels. I still think the best bit is the Impala, but hey, it's entertaining and amusing, because the cast don't take themselves too seriously. Not the best season, but it does have several high points. Not the same without the Bobby Singer character, but still good fun.", [13, 11, 11, 38, 407], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
