[5, 'There are so many things I really like about this belt. It is easy to just put things in and it really not worry about. For me it feels so much better not flipped when running....but then I am afraid my stuff will fall out. I wear it lower down to my hips than my waist. I wavered between 3-4 stars....I gave it 4 because for the price and the fact it is way better than anything I have used before (I used to use a legit fanny pack for long runs). I love that when you run with this product you get hardly any bounce...even with my Samsung galaxy S4. It fits snug...not that easy to get out while running.', [0, 0, 0, 0, 140], [0, 0, 0, 0, 11]]
