[5, "I bought this because my fianc\x90Â© suffers with ME and gains pain relief from massage and I must say that this folding table had been a godsend for my suffering knees and back and more importantly her neck. Now rather than kneeling at the side of the bed I can massage the painful areas and ease the torque on my back and knees by being able to work both sides with ease rather than leaning over at an awkward angle. The table is pretty  robust and is easy to set up and put away, although it is a tad heavier than I expected, it isn't unmanageable. It is an excellent buy and I'm very pleased with it.", [0, 0, 0, 3, 8], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
