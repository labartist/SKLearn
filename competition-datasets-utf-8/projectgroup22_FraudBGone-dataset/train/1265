[5, "Love these! They DO tend to pull out of your ear if you are moving around a lot, but it isn't nearly as bad as some folks are posting. They wouldn't be the best for wearing during a gymnastics event, but aren't bad at all for normal activity. Also are great for driving in the car since you can easily use only one earbud. The mic is clear. Battery lasts for 3 or so hours of constant talking/listening, and sound quality is good. The package includes 3 different sized earbuds too. Very happy with these.", [0, 0, 0, 3, 87], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9]]
