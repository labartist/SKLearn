[5, 'I bought this as a present for my nephews birthday and he absolutely loves it. I bought it for when he goes back to school in September but he has been using it on trips out most of the holidays. It has a cool shark head design which he really loves. The size of it is a bit deceiving, it doesnt look any bigger than a standard back pack but the design means there is plenty of room inside for his Nintendo DS, some books and toys. Its a good quality backpack that seems to have been put together really well. He loves it', [4, 0, 0, 1, 5], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
