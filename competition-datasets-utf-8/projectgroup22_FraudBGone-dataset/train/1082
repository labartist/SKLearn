[5, "The unit itself is very well designed and manufactured, very stable whilst in use, the remote control is quite small but adequate (it works best from the side or rear of the projector, and you need to supply 2 x AAA batteries, I use rechargeable ones which saves money in the long run) you can view movies, pictures, text and music, each one is accessible from the main menu. - connectivity is good too, there's VGA, HDMI, SD Card, USB and AV so plenty of choices there, all in all I'm very happy with this product, especially at the price, it does everything I need a projector for so no problems, I have to give it 5 stars for the quality and price, they're both excellent!", [0, 1, 1, 4, 63], [1, 0, 0, 1, 158]]
