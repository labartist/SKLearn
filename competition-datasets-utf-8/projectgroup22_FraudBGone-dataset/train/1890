[5, "I love my fitbit but looks too sporty for certain occasions, this band makes it perfect for nights out, meetings, weddings and work events. Luckily, the small barely fit perfectly (it can be a tad bit tighter) on the smallest adjustments so if your wrist is super small, it may be a little loose, but otherwise it's perfect. It's not too heavy and fits comfortably. It has a bit of a metal odor but not too over powering--hoping that doesn't change with wear. Overall It's was a great buy, no regrets. I'd purchase again.", [2, 0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8]]
