[5, "Don't believe the top critic comment saying that the cable doesn't fast charge and that's bad. The cable ISN'T SUPPOSED to fast charge. Fast charging with an A-C cable like this will sap more voltage then is safe for your charger/computer, causing it to break. This cable doesn't do that and follows spec which is excellent and why I am giving it 5 stars.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 142], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5]]
