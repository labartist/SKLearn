[3, "This watch is over priced for what it claims to do. The heart rate monitor is not accurate, very jumpy and usually too high.  The pedometer is the same, the first 1000 steps of the day is usually too high... After that it becomes a bit more accurate. The other features are the alarms, which can be really convenient. The app is awful. It has really let this watch down. It does not sync automatically and freezes after 2 days of use. The only way to sync it, is to uninstall, reinstall and rewrite all the information. A complete reboot which is highly inconvenient. If this watch was \x95£10 to \x95£15, I'd say you get what you paid for... But I paid twice this price so I feel ripped off. I bought it to track my HR and steps, the alarm was a bonus. It has failed to do so. I am keeping it as a watch and an alarm, which are the only two good things.", [94, 58, 62, 123, 449], [3, 0, 4, 15, 33]]
