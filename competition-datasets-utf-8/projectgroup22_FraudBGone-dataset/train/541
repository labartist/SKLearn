[1, "This is clearly a complete SCAM.  DO NOT BUY.  I ordered this cover on 24 October, paying \x95£1.99 for the item itself, and a whopping \x95£3.59 for the privilege of having it delivered (most basic delivery option).  I  was amazed that the anticipated delivery date was 23 November, but it's is now 2 December and not only is there no sign of the goods, but no correspondence from either Amazon or the seller, or even any tracking information on my Amazon account.  The cover was for my 9 year old, who has asked on an almost daily basis if it's arrived yet, so I cannot tell you how cross I am to find it has not even arrived by now.  I have one very disappointed 9 year old.  If I could give zero stars I would - I have nothing at all to show for my \x95£5.58 !!!", [7, 6, 10, 18, 61], [4, 0, 1, 1, 5]]
