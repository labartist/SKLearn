[5, "I know what your thinking, quality sound. I had the same question but went with the reviews and the Return policy. Sound is pretty good. Far better than a laptop speaker or my iPhone. The attached cord makes plugging in easy, but Bluetooth is simple. Last week, I was in a work meeting where 3 people were huddling around a Samsung speakerphone and could barely hear anything. I plugged in this speaker and in 2 seconds, perfect sound and mic. Couldn't be happier. Also, product services contacted me a week or so after I ordered it just to make sure I was happy. Nice touch guys.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 90], [0, 0, 0, 0, 11]]
