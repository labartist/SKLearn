[5, 'I purchased the smaller sized cover which fitted neatly over my north face bag with some space to spare. The cover has string pulls so this was easily pulled tight to fit snugly onto my back pack which makes it hold in place more securely. I just wanted a plain cover without spending too much money so this was perfect, although I_\x86_m not overly keen on the large brand image in the middle of the cover, this doesn_\x86_t really bother me too much.', [0, 1, 0, 4, 20], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
