[5, "Very good product, a bit thin and whippy, but strong enough to hold a quite heavy long cardigan (winter weight - mid thigh length). Because they are slimline they allow a bit more room in the wardrobes too and quite happily took the weight of my wife's two-piece pure wool skirt and jacket which is fairy weighty. For the price they are very good value for money and the velvet nap (so the wife says) stops her silky blouses and cotton tops and dresses slipping off. A good product, efficiently packaged by an excellent supplier. Highly recommended!", [12, 8, 15, 50, 366], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
