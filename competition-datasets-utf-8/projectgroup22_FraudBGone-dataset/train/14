[1, "Not much cop at all, printed two photos and then all I could get was streaky mess. As a network and Hardware Engineer I have always previously bought Manufacturers original or their recommended remanufactured cartridges as it has been (as it was in this case) my experience that third party remanufactured cartridges and toners are sub-standard at best and can damage a printer at the worst. In a moment of poverty I bought these and now wish that I had not, as my printer now needs a thorough clean. I'll be buying genuine cartridges or those remanufactured by the Manufacturer from now on, I suggest anyone thinking of buying these does too.", [1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
