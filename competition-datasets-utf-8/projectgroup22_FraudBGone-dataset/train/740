[5, 'What can I say! From the very first day I installed it, I have not had one single deposit left in my garden. Cats still move through my garden but creep very timidly along the fence, keeping an eye on the ScareCrow the whole time.

I never thought I would ever write such a positive report on a cat deterrent but the result has been remarkable. I cannot recommend this product highly enough. It really works. I purchased it through Amazon for about \x95Â£50 but have seen it advertised for alot more, so have a look round.', [38, 18, 25, 68, 332], [0, 0, 0, 0, 36]]
