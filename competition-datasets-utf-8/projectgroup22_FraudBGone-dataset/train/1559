[5, "I play guitar mainly but I recently bought a Ukulele as I wanted to try out something new. Unfortunately it was a bit small for my fingers to I have put it aside as a present for my niece. I bought this strap to go with it. I've tested it out and its nice and strong and holds the instrument firmly in place. It was dead easy to fit and the cute design on the strap compliments the Ukulele. It doesn't have any rough edges so I'm pretty sure it wont dig into her neck when she is using it. She will love it", [0, 0, 0, 0, 7], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
