[5, 'Excellent little gadget which was was dead simple to set up. I simply paired my iPhone with the transmitter using the Bluetooth connection and now I can stream for streaming music from my iPhone to the car stereo. It also has a built in microphone for making hands free calls and a dual USB port - perfect for the family to charge our devices on long journeys.', [0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
