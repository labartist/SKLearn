[5, "I wanted to properly inspect how water tight it is before I trust it to put my expensive camera in it. I filled it up with water to see if there's any holes and to see if I notice any weak parts, but it held to the test no problem. All seams are well glued together, ant the top part, if you roll tight it and then clip the buckle, holds water out very well. No a drop came out. Like that it has adjustable and removable backpack type straps, very easy to remove and put it back on. Once clipped in stays in place.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 9], [1, 1, 1, 5, 56]]
