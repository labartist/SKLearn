[5, "A good comprehensive mass builder. It would be cheaper to get the ingredients separately (protein and creatine plus carbs) but it's convenient like this. Use at least 600ml of water for three scoops and be careful not to take too much as it is almost 600 calories per serving which may make you gain too much fat as well as muscle depending on your diet.  Also be careful not to inhale it too much as it's a very fine powder. Chocolate tastes good and overall I would recommended it for people wanting to gain mass like bodybuilders and powerlifters.", [65, 40, 61, 166, 648], [0, 1, 0, 0, 21]]
