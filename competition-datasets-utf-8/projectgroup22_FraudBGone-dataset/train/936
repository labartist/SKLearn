[5, "An inexpensive and yet quite well-made set of panel beaters tools that will supplement the forty-year-old ones I have as they're getting, like me, past their sell-by date. The hammers are comfortable to hold and well-balanced and deliver a good solid blow without the 'reverberation' that one can sometimes experience with a wooden handle that isn't hickory! There were a couple of minor blemishes on the comma-wedge, but nothing that would cause this nice little set to lose points. The set comes in a nice plastic case that helps keep the set tidy and ready to hand. All over a very good set of tools that will help in the restoration of my wife's Puma. Very impressive value for money. There is one point to be aware of, these are body-work tools and the hammers are designed to be used on thin sheet metal, for which they are admirably suited, not for any heavier usage as whilst robust they are designed to straighten dented panels, not anything else, as in MMA (stick-electrode) welders don't use the pick-hammer as a chipping hammer, it'll wreck it.", [0, 0, 2, 7, 15], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
