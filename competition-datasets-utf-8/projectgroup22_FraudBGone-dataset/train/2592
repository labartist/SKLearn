[5, "I love my blanket. I've bought the single which when placed just under where my pillow is, goes all the way down until about five inches from the end of my bed. If placed in the middle, it's five inches away from either edge of the bed. The third setting heats up in about two minutes but also cools down just as fast. The first and second setting take about 6-12 minutes to heat up. I've been using this for over a month now and it's been great so far. Delivery was a bit slow but it was around Christmas time so that was expected. It came very well packaged in its original box.", [44, 18, 53, 107, 415], [3, 0, 4, 15, 33]]
