[5, "This is the second I have bought (this one was for my partner). Does not spill AT ALL, can drink from any angle and almost perfect size for Costa Medio cappucino - depending on how much foam they do. That said, you can release the inner part when you put the lid on and any excess foam comes up the middle rather than down the sides, so one slurp and it's clear. Keeps drinks warm for ages - especially if you haven't put milk in. Well worth spending more.", [0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [3, 2, 2, 0, 8]]
