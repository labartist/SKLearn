[5, 'Brilliant book from a great author. I have loved the night side tales from the first book. Full of lovely humour with just the right element of drama mixed with a little angst. Sad to see John Taylor may not return, onecan only hhope some enlightened producer decides to have a crack at making these books into either a film or a series. Simon R Green is excellent and I thoroughly recommend this book.', [0, 0, 1, 5, 17], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
