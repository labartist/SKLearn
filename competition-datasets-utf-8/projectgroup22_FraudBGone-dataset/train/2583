[5, "These are awesome. I did have them packed and ready to return but decided to give another try. As audiophiles review you do have to get the fit right. And that's no easy task. Took me three weeks. But once they fit right you feel like you are sitting in the middle of the orchestra. And believe it or not I was. They sound great for tireless listening as iPhone iPod headphone ear buds too but take time to put on and off. However worth it for the isolation. That is once you get the fit. Hope review helped.", [9, 4, 3, 0, 193], [0, 0, 0, 0, 16]]
