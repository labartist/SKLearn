Makeup,notepad,keys,deodorant,perfume,dairy,pens,head scarf,paracetamol,body spray,kindle tablet,mobile phone,drinks bottle,umbrella,cigarette box and lighter,A5 course pad,crisps,chocolate bar,a pair of gloves,Beeny  hat,mini photo album,chewing gum and many more miscellaneous bits.It held it all and hung on my shoulder very comfortably. The strap could be a little longer so that it fitted better when worn across the body.. I would definitely recommend this bag to anyone and every one.Bonus it's water prove too. :)", [14, 8, 21, 45, 109], [10, 4, 7, 21, 153]]
