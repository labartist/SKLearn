[5, 'This book should be compulsory reading for all people, not just a younger audience for whom it seems to be targetted. Trust me on this and I do mean, trust me. But maybe before you do trust me, go and buy and read this excellent volume that shows you ways to recognise the stories and people that are full of hot air, that are plainly wrong, scientifically (such as global warming deniers) or historically (yes, the Holocaust did happen!) speaking. A fault with these books is that they can become too polemical. Fortunately, John Grant avoids preaching from his soap box; maybe he gets near it sometimes, but only occasionally is there a merest hint of being in a lecture hall. But this is just me being picky. Overall, Debunk It! is a super read that will help everyone to debunk the garbage thrown at us by fools and political manipulators.', [0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 1, 8, 24, 26]]
