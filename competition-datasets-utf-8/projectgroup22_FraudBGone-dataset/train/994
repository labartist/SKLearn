[5, "This fitness tracker is awesome! My husband and I both have the Garmin Vivoactives, and we got this for our daughter. She's 9 years old and loves it. She felt really left out without a fitness tracker since we both have the Garmin version of the watches, and she can sync right along with us. You absolutely cannot beat the battery life- no charging!! We have to charge ours, but if we were to get her a Fitbit, she wouldn't be able to sync along with us for one, and for two, I know she would forget to charge it all of the time! She's only 9 years old, so you know kids that age aren't going to remember to charge it. She has a phone, and just syncs it. So I can tell you, easy enough a kid can use it! Because my 9 year old figured it all out herself.She has gotten it wet multiple times, and no problems at all! SHe says it's really comfortable, and really likes that it has the time and date on it like an actual watch would. This really motivates her to get up and moving, with this day and age kids really don't like to do that anymore. They like to sit in their rooms and play on electronics. I absolutely recommend!!", [3, 0, 0, 0, 122], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9]]
