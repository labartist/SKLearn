[5, "I bought the large even before my puppy arrived as I will use this when I walk him over the fields early morning and evenings. So it's too big and heavy for him and he's not used to collar wearing so if I ever work out how to get the accompanying video uploaded ignore his scratting! The product itself is worthy of 5 stars. It's got a strong metal buckle and the material itself feels very strong and flexible. It also has some padding added in the neck lining that will hopefully make it more comfortable for the pooch! As my pup isn't allowed out yet I tried the lights on a dull day indoors. Even in this light they were very bright and no doubt on a dark night he will be visible from a long distance away. I had them on flash hence the title Disco Dog! I just hope they aren't so bright that they freak him out! Anyhow on first impressions they are worthy of 5 stars and in my opinion represent good value for money (high praise indeed from a tight fisted Yorkshire man!). I have no idea about battery life etc but any issues I will update my review when we've had some proper field trials!", [15, 11, 15, 25, 92], [2, 1, 2, 5, 21]]
