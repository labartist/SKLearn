[5, "A fantastic piece of kit at a very good price, delivered the next day. Fairly easy to use in it's simplest format, but it has so many features which will take me some time to explore and get used to. I use it for our 3/4 piece band and it allows me to record separately and overdub, and also use through editing/mixing programs. Great quality sound reproduction and easy to connect to pc for saving/copying etc. Would recommend.", [8, 3, 3, 11, 75], [0, 0, 0, 0, 36]]
