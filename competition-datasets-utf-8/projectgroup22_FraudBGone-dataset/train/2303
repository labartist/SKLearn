[5, "I really like it, especially compared to a cheap generic and a friend's Fitbit. The numbers are large and easy to read, especially outdoors where the smaller faces and types are impossible. The strap also stays on really well with the holding band, although a little hard to get on at first. My only gripe would be that it takes a few goes for it to connect to synchronise with my phone. Overall, very happy with this product and have recommended it to friends.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 165], [0, 0, 0, 0, 11]]
