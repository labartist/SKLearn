[5, "Fantastic product. Battery life is even better than stated in the spec and the quality of phone calls is excellent. I use it in the gym with my phone in an arm band phone holder so I don't get tangled in the cables while listening to my tunes. I was worried that the amount I sweat would damage them but they are doing well so far. Handy volume, song skip/previous track and pause play buttons mean you don't have to get your phone out all the time. Highly recommended and excellent product for the price.", [50, 44, 82, 304, 797], [0, 1, 0, 0, 21]]
