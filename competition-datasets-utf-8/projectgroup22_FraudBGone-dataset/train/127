[5, "Android TV boxes are multimedia devices that run Google's android operating system. This one comes with Android version 6.0 and comes with everything you need to start using it right out of the box. There is an HDMI cable, power supply and a remote control. The box itself has various applications pre installed so its a simple case of plugging in the relevant cables and off you go. It also comes with Google Play Store which allows you to download and install additional applications. Its a perfect all in one box for running streaming apps such as Netflix, or for playing games. It was simple to setup and the box runs really quickly. The picture quality is excellent and unlike some applications that run from other streaming devices, it runs without any buffering or choppiness.", [0, 0, 1, 1, 17], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
