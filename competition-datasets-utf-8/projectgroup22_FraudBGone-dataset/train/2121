[5, "I've always had pretty poor luck with these types of air pumps, but this guy works great! It feels far more solid than others I've tried and has lasted through six uses (which I know doesn't sound impressive, but the others I've tried have broken after two) and I'm not worried about using it for many in the future. The way it's set up it's easy to pump no matter how high the pressure is, and there's minimal leakage when removing the pump from the valve. Very pleased overall. And it fits easily in the outer pocket of my pannier!", [0, 0, 0, 0, 88], [0, 0, 0, 0, 14]]
