[5, "By far the best album yet. BVB continue to improve, so this is a must if you like good musicianship, which the lads are as can be demonstrated by the multitude of live clips and the blog by Jake Pitts who with Jinx's lend BVB a very distinctive melodic, yet visceral sound. The powerful and precise percussion by CC Coma is excellent and underpins the music alongside Ashley Purdey's thunderous bass riffs. Andy Biersack continues to improve and show why he is going to be recognised with the rest if the band as one of the foremost musicians of the twenty-first century. If you're a parent with reservations, forget them, BVB are simply entertainers who give the best possible value for money and when you listen to the lyrics, in the vast majority of cases they present a message to not be frightened to express yourself and to be happy with who you are. I'm certainly not an 'angsty' teenager by some considerable margin, I just like this band and enjoy their music immensely and will hopefully get to enjoy more offerings from them in the future.", [3, 1, 1, 10, 89], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
