[4, 'I got these for my niece after she saw some other kids using skate shoes on a recent holiday. These have a lovely design and really do suit her. She especially loves the flashing lights which are really bright. She is 7 so she goes to a lot of birthday parties with school friends and she is the envy of all her friends. The only downside is that the listing initially says that you can charge these by USB, unfortunately this is not possible hence only 4 stars.', [0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
