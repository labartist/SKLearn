[5, 'I think this album is a return to similar style to the first and I really like songs like "Deth Starr" & "The Ballad of Hollywood Jack and the Rage Kage" which are very funny. The stand out track for me is "Roadie", not only is it a great song in terms of composition but also the lyrics are a really nice tribute to hard working roadies that make live music gigs possible.', [3, 2, 6, 11, 46], [3, 1, 0, 4, 38]]
