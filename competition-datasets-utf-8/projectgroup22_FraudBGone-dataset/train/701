[5, "I thought i'd give the hand cranking a go so I wound it up just for about a minute and the light was really bright, in the instructions you are supposed to crank it for 6 minutes to give you an hour of light so I can imagine it's really bright after that length of time! - I also like the 'lobster' clasp idea, this enables you to hang it up virtually anywhere which is useful, the three bulbs are seriously bright which will give you more than enough light for general needs, it's a handy size too, small enough to fit into any pocket or even a handbag if your wife needs it, all in all I'm very impressed if I'm honest and I'm very happy with it, enough so to give it 5 well deserved stars! *****", [0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [1, 0, 0, 1, 158]]
