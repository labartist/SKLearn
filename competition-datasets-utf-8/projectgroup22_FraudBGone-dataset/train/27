[1, "While these have quite good sound reproduction, the wireless function does not work.  It will connect to a computer/smart phone. The sound system's Bluetooth function will also connect to a computer/smart phone. But the headphones will not connect with the sound system.  Worse, the wires that come with the headphones are very short--not much more than a meter, which means to use them you have to be sitting very close.  Altogether, not recommended due to the lack of wireless connectivity.", [2, 1, 0, 2, 76], [8, 7, 25, 16, 59]]
