[5, 'I love this product. I got a Samsung Galaxy Note II and use it to listen to my music in my car and the GPS. I need a mount that would take the device with a flip cover and is ergonomic. I was able to easily install it in minutes and it works great. I like the fact that you just push the device against the back so that the sides grab the device and keep it in place. And then squeeze the side buttons to release it. Really happy so far with the product.', [0, 0, 0, 0, 127], [0, 0, 0, 0, 11]]
