[5, 'On a recent holiday, my nephew say some kids with light up shoes and has been pestering his mum for some ever since. I bought him a pair of these LED light up trainers and he absolutley loves them. I have to say that the pictures on here really do not do them justice, they look really great and are a well made pair of shoes, they do not look cheap at all. The best thing about them though is their defining feature, the lights. They are so bright and colourful, far brighter than the trainers he saw while on holiday. The colours change and they flash too. There is a little charging port just on the inside which is great because you dont have to mess about dismantling the trainers to replace any batteries.', [1, 1, 0, 1, 8], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
