[5, "What a great great buy!! We have two small dogs and before we used one lead with an extension at the end to get two dogs hooked in, but they just used to toss each other around, especially when one's doing toilet business,  it was quite a sad sight.  But this leash is great.  it's separated close to the handle, so dogs have more freedom from each other. The lenght is very good too,  not too long and not too short. At first wasn't sure about the actual handle for the owner, but changed my mind after the first walk.  I think it's just a matter of getting used to it. My husband was the same, but now he enjoys it, because our previous leash wasn't wide enough for his big hands. Highly recommend it. It would suit any size dog pair as the leash is quite thick, buy light.", [2, 1, 0, 3, 12], [1, 1, 1, 5, 56]]
