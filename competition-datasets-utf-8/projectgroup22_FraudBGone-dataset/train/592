[5, "I have used this with a couple of guitars and the results have been great. You can either download the AmpliTube app from the apple store, or use another application such as Garageband and you have a virtual multi-effects pedal all stored on your phone. There is a standard headphone socket but personally I use a stereo to stereo cable to connect the PC for easy recording, plus the sound comes out of my hi-fi speakers and it sounds really good. Because the iRig is so portable and quick to setup, I often connect the output to my surround sound amplifier and rock out in the living room. It is so versatile and quick to set-up I've found that I am actually playing my guitar a lot more these days.", [0, 0, 1, 1, 6], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
