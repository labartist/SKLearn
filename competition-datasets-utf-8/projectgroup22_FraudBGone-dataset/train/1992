[5, "Wonderful and worth it. So far I've had it for five months and it's still the same as when I got it. It works perfectly and hasn't fallen apart like most headphones I've had in the past. It's battery life also lasts me throughout the day ( i haven't actually checked how long it lasts before battery dies because I constantly switch on and off during breaks,class,work...etc. ) this is a great product and I would definitely buy again if need be.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 93], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9]]
