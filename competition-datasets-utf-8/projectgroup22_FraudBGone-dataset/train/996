[5, "THIS RUNNING BELT IS AMAZING! I mostly wear yoga pants (or some variation of) while working out, so I have no place for my stuff except a locker. With this belt, though, I instantly have pockets! I don't have to lug my purse to the gym anymore and it's amazing =D I got a medium to wear around my hips (I'm a 36-27-38) and it fits great. I've worn this for regular gym activity (lifting, cardio) as well as to barre and yoga class and I'll completely forget I'm even wearing it (which is a good thing). I'm buying one for my husband and would definitely recommend it to a friend!", [0, 0, 0, 0, 140], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]]
