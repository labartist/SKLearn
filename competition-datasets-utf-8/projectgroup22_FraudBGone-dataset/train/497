[4, "Sadly a brilliant TV show that was ended without a real effort to tie up loose ends. The cast as always were brilliant and the stories up to scratch, but there was almost something indefinable missing, as though the cast were winding down, but their sheer professionalism gave their all to keep the usual fast pace. I suspect the real FBI would flinch a few times at the maverick methods of the Jack Malone character and the inter-team romances, but otherwise the way that the team puts together the information, including very real instances of 'catching a break ' quite randomly as is often the case in any police work and not always finding the victim in time gives Without a Trace it's edge of realism that others within this genre lack. A cross-over between Without a Trace and Criminal Minds would have been fun if CBS had been of a mind to  bring it together, but I guess they were unwilling. Sadly the team that entertained us is no more, but the show retains its grit and drive and in time CBS might treat us to a TV special or two? Buy it if you're a fan you'll enjoy it.", [3, 0, 0, 1, 2], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
