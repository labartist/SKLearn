[5, "I got these a few months ago when the headphones Jack in my old phone broke. These headphones were only going to be a temporary till I got a new phone. Here I am 3 months later still using them. I like how the controls are set up allowing me to adjust volume as well as skipping tracks. I don't use them as much for fitness as I do my commute to work on the train. My only con is it has about a 3 hour battery life. It's a bit of annoying but would not stop me from getting them again", [0, 0, 0, 3, 87], [0, 0, 0, 0, 13]]
