[5, 'Great product, very handy to get a nice crisp base on the pizza with a thin and crispy version, and bakes a standard thickness one nice and evenly too. Do be careful to allow the stone to fully cool before rinsing as a friend injudiciously put hers straight into swater and it cracked, but that was not the fault of the product. Altogether a very good pizza stone. Highly recommended', [32, 7, 16, 37, 172], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
