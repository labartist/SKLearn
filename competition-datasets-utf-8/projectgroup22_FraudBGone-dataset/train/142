[5, "They're a great dog (and baby, lol) toys!  Got them sooner then expected,  which is always a bonus!  They're all rope which is great for dogs teeth, cleans them so well, this is the main reason I like rope dog toys. They're also tough, I have two dogs and they love playing tug and pull with each other,  and they chew a lot, these stand a chance to last some time. Tried to take more photos of each toy, but the dogs got so exited when saw it, I only managed to take one of all. Will definitely buy them again and recommend it to others.", [0, 1, 0, 1, 29], [1, 1, 1, 5, 56]]
