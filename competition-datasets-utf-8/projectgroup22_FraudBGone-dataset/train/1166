[4, 'This is a great little night light and is perfect for the kids nursery. With the lid on its supposed to be a lamp, however its not very bright at all and only serves as a very dim background light. Take the lid off thought and the whole room is illuminated with colourful stars. With the lid off the light is really powerful and creates a pretty display on the walls and ceiling. The timer is a nice feature, allowing you to set it and the light will go off when it counts down to zero.', [0, 0, 5, 3, 12], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
