[5, "Suggested to me by Consumer Reports, I am glad I bought these headphones. I cannot test all the competing products, so I became a CU subscriber years ago. I am very happy with the product, the set of three sizes of flexible in-ear fittings, and the sound. My friends apparently like the quality of my voice transmissions; they don't complain about the quality of my voice when using the phone. What more can I ask for? They work well and the price is quite reasonable.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 173], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]]
