[1, 'A major disappointment. This account of an important battle is totally incomprehensible. Despite all kinds of detail there is no sense of the ebb and flow of events, as all is lost in this kind of detail:"From the DZ, the plan called for the company to advance slightly south toward the two road bridges, one carrying the Endhoven-Boxtel road and the other over that road to the north. Parallel to the road and further west was a pair of rail bridges, with the town of Best between the northern road and rail bridges. The initial advance was over open meadows, then the party assigned to the sourthern  bridges would proceed through the western edge of the Sonasche Forest and emerge into a clearing in the area of the road bridge." Page after page of such abstract descriptions, given the fact that the few maps in the book are useless, and it is impossible to locate any of the action on them. Each separate encounter of any merit is given a certain degree of detail but there is no sense of the overall battle. The only interesting feature of the book are appendices dealing with an evaluation of the planning faults of General Montgomery and the failure of the British forces to out perform the Germans, and a very sad account of how the failure ended up blamed on the brave Polish officer and his men who participated in the battle. This is truly a badly written book, at best of interest to students of military history. The author speaks highly of Cornelius Ryan\'s book, "One Bridge Too Far," but criticizes its lack of details. His book is in overly abundant correction to that, in that he totally loses the battle for this or that skirmish.', [1, 2, 2, 0, 3], [8, 7, 25, 16, 59]]
