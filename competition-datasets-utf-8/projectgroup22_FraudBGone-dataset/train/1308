[5, "I'm so not happy that this brilliant series has been killed off far too early! Grimm has fabulous three-dimensional characters, great plotlines and enough humour to stop it from being overly dark. Other fans agree that Grimm could have easily carried two or more seasons more and still retained its fresh approach, but sadly it isn't to be. Nick, Hank, Munroe, Rosalee, Juliette, Adeline and Wu are great characters as is Renard and for the fans they will be sorely missed.", [0, 0, 7, 10, 210], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
