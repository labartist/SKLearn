[5, "This one was bought to replace our old Hitachi massager when it finally conked out. It's light, and surprisingly quiet for a massage wand that is less than half the price of the more expensive big-name brand. It works very effectively upon the knots that develop because of ME on my wife's neck, back and shoulders and is smooth enough to use on joints too with care. Altogether an excellent supplement to manual massage that  is well constructed and comfortable for the one applying it for massage and the recipient too. Highly recommended.", [2, 0, 0, 1, 22], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
