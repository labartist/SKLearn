[5, 'This is an excellent laser pointer which fits comfortably in the hand. The buttons feel solid and are easily accessible. I have used this on two presentations already and it has worked a treat. It also doubles up as a powerbank which is useful for providing backup power to your mobile phone in emergencies. The pointer is light and simple to use and syncs easily with your PC. Its also a great for a bit of fun winding up the cat :-)', [0, 0, 0, 0, 4], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
