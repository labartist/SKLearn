[5, "Very good and very comfortable headphones. I have an iPhone 6 Plus which I use to connect to the headsets. Sound quality is sufficient, more than I had expected. The earpieces fits perfectly. I use them for running everyday and the fit is comfortable. It may be slightly tight if you wear it for several hours. I had faced some problem with bluetooth connection twice. Once you pair it with your phone, it disconnects after every minute and reconnects. Restarting the headset resolves the problem. Apart from this small issue, everything is more than expected. I haven't used it for more than 2 hours so can not comment on the battery life but it is sufficient as it shows half battery after 2 hours. Overall, I am pretty impressed and pleased with this product. I would definitely recommend this for sports application.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 80], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4]]
