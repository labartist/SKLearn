[5, "Bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it. I lost interest after this series, but then I'm not a fan of a show that constantly promotes the so-called genius IQ of a somewhat inept character in Brennen and it irritates a little when Booth is portrayed as a bit dense when I sincerely doubt that the FBI (who have a minimum entry requirement of a college degree) would entertain his application and who is apparently extremely proud that he is a 'Jock' and not a Squint. I would also be dubious of him being made an SAC too because they are very experienced and intelligent team leaders for goodness sake and Booth constantly apparently struggles with even mundane scientific principles. To be honest Bones is far better than many series involving the FBI, which whilst (as with all government departments worldwide) it has its issues is considered to be one of the preeminent law enforcement agencies and I suspect that the FBI gets a bit sick of being portrayed in some of the popular TV shows as a bunch of witless grunts that allow serial killers to escape or run around apparrently aimlessly without any kind of direction. Still I guess that a certain amount of belief suspension is needed so if you can forget my issues it will entertain you.", [2, 0, 6, 14, 97], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
