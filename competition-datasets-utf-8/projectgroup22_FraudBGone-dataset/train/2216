[5, "I have had the Nike bands before this one. I like this Garmin better. It's on all the time, and although not rechargeable, it says the batteries will last a year. It also measures how well you sleep. I'm still trying to see if the step count is accurate. So far it seems to be pretty spot on. It fits really well, and I have worn it in the shower, without any problems. The sync with my iPhone works well, and gives the necessary info in chart detail.. All in all a good sports band for the money. So far I am totally pleased!", [0, 0, 0, 0, 127], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9]]
