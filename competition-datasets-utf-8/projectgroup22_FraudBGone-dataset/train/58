[4, 'Took a while to arrive, but well worth the wait. A bit noisy, but works well when used to ease the cramps from the neck and lower back. The wand is reasonably light and yet feels well constructed. A very useful massage tool that has helped with back, leg and neck pain. Lost a star for being much noisier than the Hitachi version we had but as that model is prohibitively expensive this one is a very good substitute. Just be prepared for a fairly long wait for it to arrive from China.', [10, 6, 6, 14, 90], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
