[5, 'A very beautiful bracket especially for the price. I would recommend  this to anyone and also think that this would make a lovely gift for bridesmaids which I intend to do. It is quite heavy in weight which shows the quality of the product. Although it comes in a pretty pouch there is a large 925 black stamp on it which makes the pouch useless which is a great shame  otherwise a lovely gift in itself', [24, 6, 31, 37, 206], [10, 4, 7, 21, 153]]
