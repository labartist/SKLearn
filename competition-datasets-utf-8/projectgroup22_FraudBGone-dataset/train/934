[5, 'I give these five stars for value for money (and speed of delivery). The quality is pretty good for the price and provided you take light cuts and use coolant they work well too. As I only use my milling machine for very light use they should last as long as my twenty-year-old Dormer ones, although time will tell. The buyer needs to be aware that these are perfect for light work and will need copious amounts of coolant and following those provisos they will serve you well. An excellent product for the price.', [0, 0, 0, 2, 5], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
