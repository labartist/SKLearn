[1, "Good for light use at home, not bad at all, well worth the money. Product update! Looked at these a bit closer and realised how poor they actually are. The taps have the flute roughly ground  and there is no taper tap for half of the set. The dies don't cut anything harder than aluminium and not that very well. Had to go to Halfords and get a half decent set. Do not buy these! I threw them away as it wasn't worth sending them back.", [7, 0, 6, 10, 10], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
