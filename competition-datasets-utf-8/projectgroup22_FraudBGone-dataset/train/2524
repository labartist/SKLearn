[5, 'Purchased as a replacement for original mechanism in which the metal chain kept slipping through the wheel as it is a large roller blind and probably too heavy for it. Very easy to fit with multiple holes in brackets for screws, very sturdy and words perfectly. Good value and service and would not hesitate to buy again for further roller blinds.', [4, 4, 6, 23, 150], [0, 0, 0, 0, 36]]
