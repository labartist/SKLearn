[5, "These are very small (total length 24mm), very neat little clips that I bought the first time round to use to clip my home-made powder-ribbons onto my skis, for which they were perfect.  But, having found them, I have bought another pack and will use them for all sorts of practical applications, one of which is to clip a security disk onto whichever set of car keys I am using at the time.  The clip is very springy, and the metal body of the clip seems very strong and I have no fears of anything coming loose.  Altogether a very good and well made product, and I'm sure I will buy more again.", [2, 0, 3, 6, 27], [4, 0, 1, 1, 5]]
