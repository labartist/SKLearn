[5, "The kit is fairly comprehensive and fairly sturdy, but using this system requires patience and an eye for detail. Removing dents is fairly straightforward as long as there isn't a crease in the steel and sometimes the majority will pop out after getting the outer edge of the dent smoothed. I found it best to work from the outside toward the middle, but most of all it is a matter of small and steady increments. On the classic Puma I was working on it took what was quite a nasty dent out in about an hour. I confess to using my electric hot-air paint-stripper gun (and a wet tea-towel to protect the paint)  to anneal the wing a little, and that helped a bit and you can use a hair dryer if you like. Take your time and do it a bit at a time and it'll work very well indeed.", [98, 37, 41, 73, 131], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
