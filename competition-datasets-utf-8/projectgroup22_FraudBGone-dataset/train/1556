[5, "Great wireless earbuds. The only problem I had was that they work too well--they are really noise cancelling. While this is great if that is what you are looking for, it is not so great when you run outdoors on busy roads and need to be able to hear oncoming cars. I figured out how to half put them in my ear so they don't completely cancel all noise but then the bass isn't the best. They are good for not having to mess with a swinging cord while I run, though.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 336], [0, 0, 0, 0, 11]]
