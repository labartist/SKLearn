[5, "A sleeper! For anyone interested in the details of otherwise ignored adventures in WW!!, this is a keeper. Very engagingly written, and covers the fiasco of British intelligence (oxymoron in this case) and the Dutch underground. Two-thirds of the book is a captivating description of events, and the last third an analysis of the (many) failings of SOE, and a denial of conspiracy theories that the fiasco was actually a triple-cross.  A good read, though frustrating in how stupid SOE was and the awful treatment given to the Dutch agents who managed to escape and reveal that the German's had taken over the system, only for the agents to be imprisoned as tractors (later released).", [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [8, 7, 25, 16, 59]]
