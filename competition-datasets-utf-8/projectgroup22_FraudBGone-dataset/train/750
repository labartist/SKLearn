[4, 'I bought these to add some extra lighting to the wardrobes in the bedrooms of our static caravan. These were very simple to install and are very bright for the size of them. The motion sensors work really well and the lights come on as soon as the wardrobe door is opened. It makes it much easier to see inside the wardrobes now, especially as the dark nights are pulling in. The only downside is that it takes 4 batteries, but they are powerful enough to illuminate the whole wardrobe.', [0, 1, 1, 8, 31], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
