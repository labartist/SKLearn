Getting the technique of shampooing the carpets was fairly straightforward, just take your time and use the advice of other reviewers by allowing the suction to drag the shampoo and liquid up on the backyard movement.

I rate it very highly and have no problems recommending it.", [26, 9, 18, 69, 163], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
