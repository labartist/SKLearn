[5, "I love being able to see my activity and especially track my sleep since I have a newborn and am in school. The only thing I'm iffy about is that it is inaccurate. Whenever I vigorously move my hands (especially when washing my hands), it thinks I'm taking steps. Upon waking up in the morning, just going to the bathroom gets me about 50 steps whereas my bathroom is literally 7 steps away lol. I'm okay that it's not perfect but rather an estimate. But for those who absolutely need serious accurate readings for how many steps and miles, this may not be for you.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 165], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8]]
