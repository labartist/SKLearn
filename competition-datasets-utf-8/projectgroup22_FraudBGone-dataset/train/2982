[4, "Not a bad little zapper at all for the money, but it lost a star as it won't lay flat to the wall due to the cable sticking out at the back at the top. A minor irritation, but to someone cursed with the eyes and sensibilities of an engineer that likes things to be level (or plumb) it does drive you nuts. The actual function is good, but not great, again another reason why it lost a star, but given that it was inexpensive I would say that it does its job adequately. If you want a good quality bug-zapper this will serve you well, give this one a whirl, I doubt that many would be as nit-picky as I was about the cable so, yes, if you have a bug problem, this will do the necessary.", [5, 1, 1, 2, 7], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
