[2, 'A pivotal piece of advice to an author is to start with an image or assumption of who your audience is.  I am a scholar who has published 6 books. This book seems to have ignored that useful advice. It appears to have  been written for those few scholars in political history who are interested in the last details of Marxianism. It pretends to be a history of ideas, but wanders in the miasma of philosophical "theory" that was the changing world of Marx and Engels. I read every word, which is way too many. The main thrust of Marxian thinking gets lost in all kinds of details, often historical and of little consequence to Marxian theory.  Want to learn about the history of every uprising in every country where Marx was involved: this is your book. Otherwise, for an account of the major themes, look elsewhere.  BTW, I count myself a historian of ideas, but this goes overboard to a boring extreme.', [1, 1, 0, 3, 8], [8, 7, 25, 16, 59]]
