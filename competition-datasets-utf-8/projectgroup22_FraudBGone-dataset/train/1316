[5, "Bought this for my dad - he has a BMW X5 2007 - New Shape.  He is very happy with the quality and fit.  I've had a look and it doesn't fit perfectly, however I think it's damn near good enough.  It 's as snug as it looks in the product images and these represent the product very well. It's made of a kind of rubberised plastic, nice and strong and the 5mm lip is good too.  Fits easy and will definitely protect his beige carpet.  for the money i think it represents decent value for money and a good buy", [1, 0, 1, 2, 7], [2, 1, 2, 5, 21]]
