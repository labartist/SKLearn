[5, "An incredible but simple accessory that has really worked for me. I suffer from very sweaty hands when gigging and am prone to drop the odd stick. Have tried resin-type stuff but it didn't work very well for me. These allow me to really relax my grip and use natural bounce to great effect. Have a spare pair in my bag. Definitely worth a try.", [0, 1, 2, 1, 13], [0, 0, 0, 0, 36]]
