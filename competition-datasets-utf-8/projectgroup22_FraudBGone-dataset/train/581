[4, 'Nice bright set of lights for adding an extra bit of lighting to almost anywhere. I had a similar kind of light what we have used on top of the fire place in the living room. My daughter asked for some for her bedroom and I saw this double pack at a bargain price. The copper wire is quite thin so you have to be careful not to put any pins through it, but it is actually quite strong and bendy which allows you to wrap it around objects, such as candle holders and vases, and it stays firmly in place. It has some nice looking modes which you can change with the remote. We have saved a set to use at Christmas.', [0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
