[5, "I wanted something strong and safe aswell as comfortable to use. This is not as easy as it sounds however Geepet seemed to have got it just right!  It arrived very well presented in a stylish box which instantly gives that impression of quality (so would defenatly make a gift idea for any dog lovers). The lead itself I can highly recommend, the handle is soft and padded and was easy to keep a grip of, the metal clip was solid, not tinny like some cheaper leads and the cord does feel like a high grade rope you'd expect to use while climbing. Good attention to detail on all the stitching so I am confident this will last a long time. As I am always conscious about keeping my little ones safe my partner and I decided to have a mini game of tug-o-war with it before using it the first time and it stood up to the test. I won't hesitate in recommending it to all the other doggy mums and dads out there", [0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 107]]
