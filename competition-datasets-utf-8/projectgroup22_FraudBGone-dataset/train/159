[5, "It is exactly what it says it is. The fit is nice, doesn't look bad, and tracks you. Simple, but also much less than other fitness trackers. At first I was annoyed with the inactivity bar at the top. But then I realized my ocd kicks in and makes me want to get rid of it. Which means me moving more, which is part of the reason to have a tracker. I've noticed that if you don't move at all for a few minutes the display powers off until you move again, which is probably why the battery can last a year. I am very pleased with my choose and will recommend this to others.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 165], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]]
