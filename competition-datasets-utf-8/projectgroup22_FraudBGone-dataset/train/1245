[5, 'We often go for weekends away to our holiday home and pretty much the same thing happens every time. Either the day or evening before, everyone wants to charge their devices at the same time. All of the phone, tablets and power banks need plugging in and we either run out of sockets or people cant find their plugs. This nifty little device solves that problem. It allows you to connect 4 devices at once and only takes up a single plug socket. Its small which means its portable and doesnt take up any storage space when we travel. Its also cut down on the amount of chargers that we have to take away with us.', [0, 0, 0, 0, 49], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
