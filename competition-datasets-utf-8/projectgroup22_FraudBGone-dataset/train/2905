[5, "Perfect for our 3 yr old. He especially likes the road layout on the floor. It really is pop-up and is also easy to pack away and store in it's zip up bag. The separate roof allows it to be used with or without a roof. Having a doorway at both ends also means it can be used like a tunnel. A good product at a reasonable price which I would recommend.", [6, 4, 7, 17, 62], [0, 0, 0, 0, 36]]
