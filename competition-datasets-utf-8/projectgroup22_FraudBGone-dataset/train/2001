[5, "The work that Stephen Jones and his contributors put in shows in this magnificent production. This large-format publication includes chapters on the various aspects of the horror field by experts in that field -- and all heavily embellished with images of book covers, film stills and original artwork.I haven't checked in detail but I suspect you'd be hard put to find an omission from the range of artists covered.
