[5, 'Bought this cage for our 9 year old Labrador bitch who needed 4 weeks cage rest after a leg op.  As we\'ve never had a cage for our dog we felt a bit guilty about putting our pooch in "dog prison solitary confinement".  However, our dog loves it - she now makes her way back into her cage whenever she\'s bored of our company!  It\'s a well made, well thought out product. The XL cage is the perfect size for her.  There\'s plenty of room for her to lay,sit and stand and room enough to turn round.  The cage has 2 doors, a large one on the long side and a smaller one on one of the short sides so access for her is easy.  We keep the short side one open slightly with a table stopping it opening fully.  That way we can put her water bowl on the carpet just outside the cage and she can access it easily.  There would be room inside the cage but we don\'t want her knocking her water over and her wound getting wet.  I wasn\'t looking forward to putting the crate together as i thought it would be a nightmare.  Nothing could be simpler.  The 4 sides and roof are all clipped together inside the hard plastic base.  You just lift up the roof, the walls fold up and you clip them in place - simples, took less than 1 minute.  The base of the cage is made from hard plastic so while easy to clean and hardwearing, we did have to put a soft bed in here to make it more comfortable for our dog.  We bought this as part of a lightning deal, so at full price (90pounds currently) I think it\'s a bit steep, but wait till it\'s on offer and i don\'t think you can go wrong.', [1, 1, 0, 3, 7], [2, 1, 2, 5, 21]]
