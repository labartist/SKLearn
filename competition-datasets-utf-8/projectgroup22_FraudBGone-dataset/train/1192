[5, "Do you need FIVE microphones? Because when you order this, you're getting FIVE microphones. On a per microphone basis, that's the best deal you'll find anywhere, but just make sure you need FIVE microphones. That being said, these work just fine. I'm not trying to record super high definition audio or working in a high end studio. I just needed this so I could add a simple commentary to a screencast video I was embedding into a presentation, so literally the most basic of all possible functions. I have not tried this with any VOIP, Skype, voice recognition, or other recording needs, but it worked just fine for my purpose and that's all I needed. Plus, the price is unbeatable, even if you only need one of the five.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 102], [0, 0, 0, 0, 11]]
