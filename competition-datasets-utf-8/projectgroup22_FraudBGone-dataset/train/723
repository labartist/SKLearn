[5, 'This is a very very good first series, for those of us who are into psychological thrillers. Really had to sit and concentrate to understand and keep up with what was happening which only added to the excitement and enjoyment of this new series. Glad I watched it without the add breaks on my Kindle as the adds would have been a great interruption that I could not have tolerated. I am already looking forward to a night to myself to watch the second season.', [2, 0, 0, 2, 20], [10, 4, 7, 21, 153]]
