[5, "Read the reviews and decided to take the plunge.  I was downsizing from an old worn out greenhouse and just needed a place to keep my trays out of the elements.  After about 3 months of use I'm happy with this.  I was worried that it would be too lightweight and wouldn't stand up to the wind where I live as its it's quite breezy.  However it was easy to put up single handed! The cover feels quite heavy duty, much thicker than some of the cheaper ones I've seen in the range and B&Q.  I've weighed down the bottom base with a couple of heavier terracotta plant pots and so far no problems!  I'm not sure how it'll stand up to the elements in the winter, but so far so good.  Plus you can buy a replacement cover direct from the manufacturer and probably Amazon if the worst happens", [4, 2, 5, 4, 26], [2, 1, 2, 5, 21]]
