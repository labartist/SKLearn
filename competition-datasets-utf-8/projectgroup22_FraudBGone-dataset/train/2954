[5, "This is a well designed and well made piece of kit, and also compact enough for travel. The quality is evident when compared with other trimmers: this one is made of stainless steel rather than plastic like so many others. It is easy to use and to change the heads depending on what you're trimming. Cuts cleanly and efficiently and is easy to clean. Nothing to dislike about it and the company provides excellent service including a lifetime warranty. Can't go wrong.", [71, 21, 41, 246, 3182], [0, 0, 0, 0, 36]]
