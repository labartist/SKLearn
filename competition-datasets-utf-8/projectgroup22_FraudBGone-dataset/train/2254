[1, "I did not receive what is in that picture. The dress I received was a faded pink colour (I ordered a red) and what is meant to be a small to medium is much too big. The size could fit a size 12 to 16. I am a size 8 so clearly it will not do. The material is stretchy and feels like it could tear at any moment. I'm too ashamed of its quality to even pass it on to someone else. I hope the seller sees this & I get a refund. Not worth me paying the postage to send back.", [77, 71, 103, 134, 289], [3, 0, 4, 15, 33]]
