[5, "Written about my dear old Dad by my talented elder brother. The cover photo was taken in Egypt and I've always wondered how the military never realised he was only seventeen when he joined the army. Through all of the terrible things that he saw and was expected to do as a member of the fledgling special forces he remained throughout his life a gentle, kind and loving husband and father. I might be biased but this book epitomises the Nelson value whereby Dad truly did his duty and paid for that dedication for the remainder of his long life with terrible dreams. The proceeds go to a good cause that Dad was proud of and any who wish to experience the horror, comradeship and on occasions humour of a terrible conflict then read this and see what he saw and stood firm to protect. Those that he loved and the 'folks' at home that he like thousands of young men and women quietly and with great courage, fought to ensure their freedom, simply because it was the right thing to do. I hold my head higher when I read this, his sons, grandchildren and great-grandchildren are his legacy and my brother and I taught his simple beliefs to our children who in turn passed them on to their children. Love of family and friends, honesty, kindness to all and courtesy toward everyone, those were his tenets. A truly heroic man and a wonderful father.", [0, 0, 1, 0, 2], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
