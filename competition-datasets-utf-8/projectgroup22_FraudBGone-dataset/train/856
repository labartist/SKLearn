[5, 'You will probably have to try a few times to get it just right and how you like it but that is expected, it seals really quickly too, no messing around, it also comes with a complimentary 10 preservation food saver bags, five 6 x10" and five 10 x 8" which is a bonus! - one more thing I really like about this product is the space saving aspect, it doesn\'t have to be food, you can vacuum seal virtually anything and when it shrinks it saves lots of space so I would consider that option too if I were you! - all in all this is a great quality product, very well designed and manufactured, a great price and I highly recommend it, it\'s a definite 5 stars! *****', [1, 0, 3, 2, 12], [1, 0, 0, 1, 158]]
