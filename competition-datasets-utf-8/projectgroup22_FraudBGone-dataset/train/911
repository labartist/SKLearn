[4, 'I heard these stories being read out as they were written. Finally seeing them on the Kindle confirms my first impression: they are excellent, people-centred stories about those trapped in the misery of the Great War. They are not all stories about the Western Front, fortunately; some involve the early days of aerial warfare, some feature events that occurred in the UK.Some are very poignant, and some are infused with humour. A great mix. Recommended.', [0, 0, 0, 2, 8], [0, 1, 8, 24, 26]]
