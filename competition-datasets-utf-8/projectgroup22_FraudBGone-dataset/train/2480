[5, "I had wanted something like this forever,well since I got my Kindle fire HD, I had heard of this unit from a couple of friends,but not being as computer savvy as them was quite unsure it would be as easy to set up as they professed. I ordered it on their recommendations vowing I would send it back quick smart if it took me any longer than 10mins to suss out and set up, IT TOOK ME LESS THAN 5MINS. I am so pleased !!!! Have connected my Blackberry Playbook  and my mobile phone. When I'm at mum and dads ( no computers) my children, nephews and nieces can use it too. A very good product,that I would highly recommend to all.", [4, 1, 3, 9, 28], [10, 4, 7, 21, 153]]
