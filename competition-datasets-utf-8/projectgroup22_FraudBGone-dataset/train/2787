[5, 'Excellent sound for a microphone on my iphone 6s. It was clear, crisp, and recorded at a good volume. But it was only about  feet long, so it was basically useless if I wanted to use my iphone to record myself. I ordered a thirteen foot extension cord for 10, and now I have an 18 foot cord. I think  feet is good for a headset, but not good for recording.', [0, 0, 0, 0, 189], [0, 0, 0, 0, 14]]
