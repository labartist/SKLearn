[5, "I do property renovations and was looking for a damp meter to take on house viewings to spot any potential problems. I was expecting to pay a fortune for one and was a bit apprehensive at the low cost of of this device however I am more than happy with it. It works perfect and gives  audible and digital output as to the level of damp in the area you are testing. Can't find fault with it and would recommend it to anyone looking for something just for pinpointing problem areas.", [50, 13, 43, 252, 915], [0, 0, 0, 0, 107]]
