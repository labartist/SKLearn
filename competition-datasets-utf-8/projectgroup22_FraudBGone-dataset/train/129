[5, 'I bought this for my dad as a Christmas gift. He likes to collect coins, particularly gold coins, so I figured this would be an ideal tool for him. I decided to try the loope out myself and I have to say its very impressive. The magnification is really good with a nice clear image. Im not an expert but it seems the optics are really good. The LED light is surprisingly bright and is a really useful addition. The magnifier has 2 lenses, 30x and 60x magnification and allows you to look at things in really fine detail. Comes with a nice handy sized case which will keep it clean and free from dust.', [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
