[4, 'Brilliant Univibe ......I recommend you put the distortion /boost after the viscous vibe in your pedal train to avoid excessive "throb", unless its a fuzz box for some reason I don\'t understand! Vibrato is excellent but better used on clean settings. A well made, sturdy pedal. The "ramp" feature (by holding your foot on the switch) is brilliant.', [0, 1, 1, 1, 3], [1, 2, 5, 30, 18]]
