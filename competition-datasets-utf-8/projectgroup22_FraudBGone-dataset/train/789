[2, "Anyone hoping for a Dan Brown-esq rollercoaster ride of a story is going to be disappointed. I bought this because it was a recommendation for those who likes books in the same genre as Dan Brown. Suffice to say it was a loose facsimile and one that tried to be a bit too clever and involve a few too many plot twists for my taste. Having said that the concept was good and Mr Irving is a talented wordsmith but this, in my opinion is not his best offering and I hope that better things are to come. It is part of a two book story but I'm afraid I don't have the urge to find out the conclusion.", [7, 3, 11, 25, 71], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
