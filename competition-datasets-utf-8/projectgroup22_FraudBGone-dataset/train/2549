[5, 'These emit a really bright light which creates a lovely effect in any room. The colours and mode can be changed simply using the remote control supplied. The wire itself is small and quite delicate but strong enough to stay in place so can easily be bent into shape or wrapped around objects without breaking. There are tiny little bulbs scattered along the wire that are more powerful than they look. We have used these on our fireplace and were thinking about using them to decorate the tree at christmas.', [0, 0, 0, 0, 10], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
