[5, 'I bought this for my niece for her birthday, she is mad about Miss Kitty and loves anything to do with cats. She was really happy with them and has won it whenever she has gone out. She particularly likes the cute paw prints stamped on the inside of the ring. These came with a nice little drawstring bag to keep them in. The price of these is really cheap but they certainly do not look or feel cheap. There is a even stamp mark on them saying .925, overall these are a lovely little item and the perfect gift for a cat lover.', [0, 0, 0, 1, 8], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
