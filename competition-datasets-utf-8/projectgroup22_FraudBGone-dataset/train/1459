[5, "I'm not going to go into all of the uses for a bucket. but for us it is an ideal way of bringing water and the fact that it is collapsible means that it wont take any space up and therefore can be stored very easily. It seems to be well made and is durable, even though Ive only used it a few times it seems like its strong enough to last. Its quite heavy when it has been completely filled up to the top so maybe it wont get filled to capacity, but apart from that it seems great. The fact that it folds is a great idea and was the real selling point for me.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
