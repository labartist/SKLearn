[5, "I enjoyed this book from the beginning. I had not read this author's work before but would again and would recommend him to others. The plot unfolds steadily but surely and draws u in . It's a quick read too which was great for me at the time as I was reading another novel too,which is something I like to do ( read more than one book at a time) . The twist at the end is fantastic and unexpected.", [17, 43, 181, 579, 929], [10, 4, 7, 21, 153]]
