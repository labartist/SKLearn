[1, "Hat doesn't have any shape to it very flimsy, once on your head the sides flop down. Materials for the jacket and chaps are poor and very thin, great for keeping you cool at a hoe down, not good if you plan on using it more than once stitching came apart ect.

The best place for it was in the bin. Buy to look like a scarecrow...cowcrow!", [5, 3, 1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 3, 0, 6]]
