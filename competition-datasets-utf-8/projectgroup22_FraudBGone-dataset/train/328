[5, "I always enjoyed Edgar Allan Poe when at school and after watching that dreadful series The Following which, I feel portrayed Poe incredibly negatively (and which was utterly unrealistic to boot!) I felt like I wanted to revisit the classic collection. Often considered a dark and morbid writer, if one takes the time to read each story or poem you can as my old English Lit teacher always said, see the cautionary element. Not a children's bedtime story compilation, but certainly a collection of incredible work by an incredibly talented author.", [6, 3, 11, 29, 103], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
