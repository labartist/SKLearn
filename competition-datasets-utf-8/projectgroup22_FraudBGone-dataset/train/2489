[5, "As I can speed chop with a knife I didn't think that I'd have much use for this, but I have to say if used to it's optimum as per the instructions, it is a brilliant time saver. It is necessary to read the instructions Carefully! Spend a little time and have a little patience and this will reward you with excellent results. Slicing chips is a doddle too and the mandolin blade is like a razor and looks like it will be for a very long time and with protracted use. From wafer thin to chunky, this delivers really very well, all that I will say is that it is crucial that you use the slicing guard as the blade is extremely sharp. Worth the time to learn to use it properly and well worth the money.", [0, 0, 3, 4, 29], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
