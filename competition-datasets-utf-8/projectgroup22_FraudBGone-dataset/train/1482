[5, "I am pleased with the sound quality and simple on-off and volume buttons. The microphone quality is fine too though on windy days people mention that they have some difficulty in hearing me. The music comes across clearly and it's pleasure to listen to. It takes some time to figure out which ear piece fits best in one's ears. The earbuds comes with weird looking plastic ear supports that supposedly fit in one's outer ear. They don't work for me despite the variuos youtubes praising the virtures of such low tec technology. I just pop the earbuds in and they stay in. Do notice that while running the wire rubs aginst the back of my neck and tugs a bit on the inserted earbuds. To remedy this, I attach the cord, via the small clip, to the back rim of my hat thus lifting the cord off my neck. So... it takes a little practice to develop a system that works but once done everything is fine.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 92], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7]]
