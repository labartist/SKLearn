[5, "Very easy to use and put up, simply use the attached adhesive strip, which sticks to virtually any surface, there's also a spare strip which is nice, so you can place it in hidden places such as wardrobes and cupboards, or even under the stairs cupboard where there's no light, we might get another one for that reason! - it is very well designed and manufactured, made of aluminum but the back is steel I think so very sturdy, in fact I can't find a negative with this light, it's very versatile, it's a great price and I have no problem in giving this a big thumbs up and of course 5 stars! *****", [0, 0, 2, 1, 56], [1, 0, 0, 1, 158]]
