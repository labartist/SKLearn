[5, "Bought this for my son and since then he has disappeared down a gamer's black hole. He lives the console, and he adores the bundle game Wind Waker, which after all is a Zelda game. He's already bought Twilight Princess another Zelda classic. The console is a typical Nintendo offering, but offers backward compatibility, which my son is pleased with. A great 'big' present for someone you love, and sure to offer houyrs of fun.", [32, 8, 23, 58, 424], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
