[5, "What a fantastic product. I was going back and forth between this and the FitBit, but this one is just so much better. What's better than the FB? Well it's waterproof so you can shower, swim, etc (I think it's 50m ~550ft!). Also, with a battery like a watch, it has a life of over a year before you have to change it, versus charging your FB one or more times a week. Display contains everything I need including the time. The app is also great and shows your progress over time. My dad and I have competitions everyday on who gets the most steps! Very great product. I only have one con, but it's very small. You can see in regular and very bright places, but you can't see the screen in the dark. Wish there was a little light like a watch, but besides that it's fantastic!", [0, 0, 0, 0, 165], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9]]
