[4, "Any series with Gary Sinese in it will usually hit the bullseye and this is no exception. I think a couple of the characters need stronger actors, but overall it holds true to the genre that has seen Criminal Minds reach toward it's twelfth season. They need a big personality to foil the on-screen presence of Sinese, which happens with Joe Mantegna in the original incarnation, and Kirsten Vangsness as the wonderful Penelope Garcia, however it's only the first series and the cast needs time to gel. More crossovers with the original series might be nice. Five stars and a servant hope for a new series with more episodes soon.", [2, 3, 2, 5, 12], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
