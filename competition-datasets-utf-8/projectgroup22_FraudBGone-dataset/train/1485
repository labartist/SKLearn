[4, 'Im not sure what other reviewers were doing but the spray definitely does work, or at least mine does. I did have to press the button a few times at first to allow the tube to fill up and expel all of the air from the tube but after that it has been working perfectly. The bottle releases a nice mist of water which is really refreshing and doesnt get you completely wet. The bottle is the perfect size, it holds a decent amount of water without feeling too heavy or taking up too much room in my gym bag. It does take a little getting used to drinking from the nozzle but when you get used to that its fine.', [3, 0, 1, 2, 9], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
