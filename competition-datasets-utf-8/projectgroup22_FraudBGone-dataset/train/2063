[5, 'Absolutely love these headphone. I use them every time im at the gym. They are still running strong, and i sweat profusely when i work out. They are very light and they stay in and on my ears with the help of the "wing" accessory. The sound quality is surprisingly great. The bass is really nice and noticeable. The sound is very clear.
