[5, 'I have to say when i ordered this item for my gopro hero 2 i didnt think it would sound as good as it does. If your looking to get a mic for you phone or camera for a really cheap price, this is the mic to get. I 100% think this was worth the get and im really impressed. The sound is pretty good for a tiny little mic and i havent heard any background noise really popping out. if your looking to get and shirt mic or something this is the way to go.', [0, 0, 0, 0, 189], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9]]
