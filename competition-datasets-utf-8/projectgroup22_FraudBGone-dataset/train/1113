[5, "I was tired of using razors to shave my body as it took time and meant I would keep cutting myself. I thought this trimmer would leave stubble behind but it is really good, especially if you shave against the direction of hair growth it is basically as good as a razor. Very fine hairs like those on the upper arm are perhaps easier to remove in the shower with a standard razor but for the rest of the body it is very good. I use it everywhere (except the face or head, don't use it there it is no good and can cause irritation and the instructions tell you not to anyway)at it saves a lot of time when shaving the leg and buttocks areas. you can use this in your private parts as well as long as you keep the skin tight when using you'll be fine. You can use it in the shower totally fine as well, I don't find it makes much difference except it reduces friction slightly if you use it while wet. the battery life is good on a single charge as well. Very good product", [149, 85, 161, 334, 1131], [0, 1, 0, 0, 21]]
