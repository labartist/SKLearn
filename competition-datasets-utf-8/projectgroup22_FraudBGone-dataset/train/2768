[5, "Needed a new inexpensive printer urgently. This machine arrived promptly, was easy to install on Windows 10, and appears to work fine so far. In fact, I have full confidence in this HP printer/scanner/copier. I've printed colour maps and b&w text documents and the quality is pretty good -- not photo quality but you'd not get that from a 40 pound machine. It's quick, too.", [36, 13, 23, 48, 166], [0, 1, 8, 24, 26]]
