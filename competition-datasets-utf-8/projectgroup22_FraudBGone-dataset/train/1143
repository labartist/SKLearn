[5, 'The phone rests on the bottom cradle and there is space for the charging cable underneath so it doesnt get trapped. The two clamps at either side simply slide in and out to hold the phone in place. We have tried various phones from the iPhone to two different versions of the Moto G and all fit snugly in place. There is a quick release button on the rear which automatically releases the phone from the holder. Its really simple yet a clever design which can be mounted on the dashboard or as I have done in the cup holder compartment.', [1, 1, 1, 5, 21], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
