[5, "If you have really sharp knives as I do in the kitchen and you're boning or dicing meat, these are a Godsend. Although I've been careful and lucky I have come close a few times when boning a chicken or a lamb joint to slicing my fingers or hand, but with these you won't. they are comfortable and snug enough that you soon forget that you're wearing them and they genuinely are cut resistant. My knives are, as cooking is a hobby, really sharp and they didn't even mark the glove when I put it on the chopping board and sliced across it, (without my hand in it of course) to see if it would do the job. The gloves are very good value for money and are dead easy to keep clean and hygienic, so an all-round win. I highly recommend these gloves even if you are, like me an enthusiastic amateur in the kitchen as it will protect your hands extremely well. Just as an aside, these aren't good for speed chopping, but if you can speed chop (like chefs do on the tele) then you know the trick to keep your fingers out of the way. Otherwise a brilliant and worthwhile buy!", [1, 0, 0, 0, 5], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
