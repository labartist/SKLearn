[5, "So far I am really glad I purchased this running belt. It sits in place and doesn't ride up at all while running. It fits my phone fine, although it does take a little work to get it in there. The only thing I am not super happy about is that it allows sweat to soak through to my phone while running. I think next time I run I will try and put my phone in a baggie or something to keep it dry. Other than that I am super happy with this belt.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 140], [0, 0, 0, 0, 12]]
