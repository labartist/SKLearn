[5, "I was a bit skeptical that these would work very well for being so affordable, but I have been extremely impressed by the rich sound, comfortable fit, and easy controls. I got them for working out and they stay on very well when jogging. You can't tell from the pictures but the ear pieces are soft flexible rubber that fit comfortably over the ear. It is very lightweight too. I highly recommend for the price and quality.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 147], [0, 0, 0, 0, 14]]
