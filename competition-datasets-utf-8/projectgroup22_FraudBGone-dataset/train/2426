[5, 'Contary to the bias of elite, effete esthetes, music is not automous from life, society and politics, nor are its meanings \'aesthetic\' as argued by ideologues of the aesthetic orthodoxy.  Rather, it is a praxis, firmly rooted in sociocultural, economic and political \'worlds\' that are centrally engaged in deciding questions of quality, value and the like.  As a sociologist of music, DiNora presents an analysis that stands in stark contrast to typical musicological accounts of music.  Of particular value and interest in the present work is not only the social bases of musical meaning and value, but the \'social construction\' of the very idea of \'genius\' that sustains many of the myths about musical meaning and value.  This book will be eye-opening (even ear-opening) for anyone interested in a fresh perspective on "classical music" in general and, more particularly, in the milieu of Vienna at the time of early Beethoven as constitutive of many of the shibboleths, paradigms, illusions and assumptions taken for granted by many "classical" musicians, critics and connoisseurs.  Fortunately, the \'deconstruction\' of such shopworn pieties does not throw the baby out with the bathwater; it instead demonstrates the relevance of so-called \'extrinsic\' events on the supposedly \'pure\' aesthetics of music-for-its-own-sake and reveals the ideological tenor of orthodox musicological claims.', [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [8, 7, 25, 16, 59]]
