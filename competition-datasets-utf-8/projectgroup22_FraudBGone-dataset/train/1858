[5, 'Had been considering getting one for ages and I eventually came to the conclusion that I would try it before getting a new carpet. Glad I did as it has breathed new life into the carpets around our home. I looked at various models and went for this one as it has good capacity, long cables and hoses, and also has attachments for hard floors. It cost a bit extra but well worth it, especially when considered against the cost of replacement carpets. It is also very easy to use - no more difficult than using an upright vacuum cleaner. Would recommend.', [15, 4, 12, 40, 158], [0, 0, 0, 0, 36]]
