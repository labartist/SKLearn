[5, "Its probably one of the best all round rucksacks I've had the pleasure of owning since I had a Head rucksack as a teenager in the 90s, it could also be a great schoolbag for daytime, sports bag for night time, overnight bag for sleepovers. Excellent value for money, much better than the bags they sell down the market that only last a few uses before falling apart. I wish I could give more than 5 stars. I am very happy with it", [0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 107]]
