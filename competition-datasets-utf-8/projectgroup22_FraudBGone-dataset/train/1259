[4, "The product is good enough -- good quality. But it is too small for my DSLR. Despite the ascertion that it fits most DSLR upto 18cm in length (including lens) ... well, it doesn't fit my EOS 50D with 17-85mm lens (which is 16cm in length approx). It's the camera height and width that stops this product being suitable for the 50D. However, it's OK on the 350D so it's not a waste of money. I've given it four stars only because it fits my smaller DSLR.", [5, 5, 11, 17, 32], [0, 1, 8, 24, 26]]
