[3, 'This small book comares British English-American English and American English to British English, emphazising words that are different in their common usuage.  Given that some of these words have opposite meanings, e.g., "public school," the book can serve to clear up many misunderstandings.  But, in truth, the book is more of an interesting read than the reference book I hoped it to be.  More useful would have been to include also the many words commonly in use that are spelled differently (judgement in the UK, judgment in the US).  I suppose Americans and Brits who are in close contact (e.g., in business) might benefit, but I suspect I will benefit little in my teaching of English to non-UK students who were educated in UK English as a second language and who, for the most part, don\'t tend to us many of the more colloquial expressions of British English.', [0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [8, 7, 25, 16, 59]]
