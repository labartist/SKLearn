[5, "For the price you won't beat these. Eye-protection is a must as these, as with all rotary wire-brushes, shed the odd 'bristle'. Best with a mains drill and they've removed paint effectively from aluminium and steel although you need to be a bit careful on the former as these will scar aluminium if you press a bit hard.
