[5, 'I know these have received a few "dodgy" reviews lately, but from my point of view (touch wood) I cannot fault them.  Bought them to replace standard spotlights that were more expensive to run and seemed to blow daily.  I seemed to spend my life trawling the house changing bulbs.  I\'ve had these 3 or 4 months and used about 6 of the 10, so i currently have a mixture of 6W led and 40W halogens in my kitchen and bathroom.  While using a lot less energy than the halogens these also give off a much brighter light than the halogens too. So far none of these have blown and my house hasn\'t burnt down (touch wood again).  They are more expensive to buy than the halogens, but in terms of energy saving in the long run, as long as the build and last quality continues they should pay for themselves easily! The light they give off is also superior to halogens in my opinion!', [109, 49, 28, 53, 336], [2, 1, 2, 5, 21]]
