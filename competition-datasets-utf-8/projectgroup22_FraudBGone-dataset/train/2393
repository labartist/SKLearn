[5, "I bought this stand to sit alongside my drum kit so wanted something robust and stable. This certainly fits the bill. It is in good grade metal, a good size with a nice deep shelf. There are no clips to hold paper or books in place which at first I thought might be a negative, but previous reviews mentioned this so I bought some small strong magnets which are better than fixed clips as you can move them anywhere on the stand depending on what you are reading from. Adjustable in every way and easy to attach lamps. It would not be so easy to transport by being carried as it doesn't fold up small, but its sturdy construction means it would easliy stand up to being transported with other equipment. A great stand which I would certainly recommend.", [7, 10, 9, 50, 204], [0, 0, 0, 0, 36]]
