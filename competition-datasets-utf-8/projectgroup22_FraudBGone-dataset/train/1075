[5, "We loved Burn Notice and we loved this biopic of Sam Axe. Bruce Campbell gives his usual Stirling performance and oddly the film doesn't lack pace because Jeffrey Donovan only gave himself a cameo role. A grwat film and with plenty of laughs, thrills and very loud explosions. Love it!", [4, 3, 9, 12, 30], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
