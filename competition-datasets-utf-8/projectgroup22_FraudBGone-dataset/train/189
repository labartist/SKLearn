[5, "It arrived in the usual Lady Colour box but I don't mind that, I find the box to be rather classy and well designed so no worries there, in fact, if you're thinking of this as a gift for a loved one or family member they will be thrilled,  especially when they open the box and this exquisite necklace is inside! - The value for money aspect can't be beaten, I challenge anyone to find such a good quality product at the same price, you're likely to pay far more than this price tag I'm sure! - so in summary, this is a fabulous necklace. beautifully designed and manufactured, great value and I highly recommend it, hence the 5 well deserved stars! *****", [0, 0, 0, 0, 4], [1, 0, 0, 1, 158]]
