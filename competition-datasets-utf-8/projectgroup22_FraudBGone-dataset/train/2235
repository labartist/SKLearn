Although I have the first edition (released in 2000) one and some of the information is a little outdated, so would need to check back with more resent research.  so anybody who's buying this book,  don't try to safe some money by buying preowned one,  just buy the new release which has the info updated.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 7], [1, 1, 1, 5, 56]]
