[5, "The solar light doesn't take long to charge either. Since installing this the light has stayed bright. Solar technology seems to have come a long way recently, when we first started putting solar lights up in the garden they seemed to take forever to charge and only gave a dull light and quite often wouldn't last very long. This was simple to install and the light has been on all night. We really like it when its on colour changing mode. It makes the doorway to our holiday home look really pretty.", [3, 2, 1, 2, 15], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
