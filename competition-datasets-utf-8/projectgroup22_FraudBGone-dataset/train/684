[5, "A nice little ring, bought to temporarily replace my wife's proper wedding ring which is in for repair and cleaning. Very good value too at about half price. The diamonds are small but genuine too, so it won't depreciate. The boss loves it '. Highly recommended.", [1, 1, 0, 2, 10], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
