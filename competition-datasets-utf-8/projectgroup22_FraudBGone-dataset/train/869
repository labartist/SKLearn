[5, "I was tempted to replace some of our wall sockets with ones that have USB ports to make life easier when charging phones and tablets. This smart little charging hub has given us a cheaper alternative and is far more practical. Now we can charge up to 8 devices at a time. I have the hub sat on a little coffee table at the side of the settee and this allows everyone to still be able to use their devices whilst on charge, rather than having to be sat near a plug socket. (I've also bought some extra long charging cables to go with this). This has proven to be an hit for all the family.", [0, 0, 0, 7, 74], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
