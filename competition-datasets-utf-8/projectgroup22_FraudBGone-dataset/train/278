[5, "Had these for about a month now and they're still going strong. Sound is great regardless.. Bass is where it should be.. Hooked up to my OnePlus, MacBook Pro, and a friend's iPhone. Performed like a charm. Wear these around the gym with ease.. I don't run, so I cannot speculate on how they hold in that respect. Comes with clip to attach to clothing, carrying case with rubber peices to customize the fit.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 102], [0, 0, 0, 0, 13]]
