[4, "It's a lovely little notebook, a bit bigger than palm size. The leather look is cute. The pages inside are brown but look very antique (in a good way). It doesn't seem to have something to close it properly other than the string tied around. Over all, great for the price - too small to do proper journaling with but great for little notes or to use as a planner.", [3, 1, 7, 20, 50], [3, 0, 4, 15, 33]]
