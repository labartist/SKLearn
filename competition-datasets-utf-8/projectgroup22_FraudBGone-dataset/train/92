[5, 'Bought to go with my Tiger music stand and they certainly do that. They are the perfect shape to either place on top of your page or sheet, or  to hold pages back in their recess. I find them better than clips at the bottom of some music stand which do not prevent the tops of pages from falling in. These can be placed anywhere, as long as your stand is metal of course. They are strong enough to hold several sheets or pages in place. They are well made and are well worth the money. Definitely recommend.', [0, 2, 4, 5, 25], [0, 0, 0, 0, 36]]
