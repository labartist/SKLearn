[2, 'I followed the instructions for taking this product, along side healthy eating and exercising 3/4 times a week. Initially, I was so pleased as I lost around 4lbs in two and a half weeks, but after continuing for longer, I suddenly felt even fatter and bloated than I had before, without changing my diet. After a month, I had gained all the weight back and was actually heavier than I was before I stared the tablets. Now just 3 days after stopping, I feel much less bloated and fat around my stomach... Could possibly just have been a bad reaction for me personally but be careful, and keep an eye on any changes..', [164, 48, 47, 115, 324], [1, 2, 0, 1, 3]]
