[5, 'Nice quality and well made, but the size was a little larger than anticipated. Nevertheless, very comfortable and nice to wear in very hot weather. The size issue is easily offset by wearing a belt and they have a drawstring adjuster too. Highly recommended!', [13, 5, 13, 23, 61], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
