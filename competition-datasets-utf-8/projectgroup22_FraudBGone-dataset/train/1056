[5, "I love this game, it's mainly a platforming game in which you control Jill (the pink haired lass on the cover)and her drill. The game will work on any Gameboy Advance or DS as they are region free so NTSC and PAL problems don't apply. The game cartridge is slightly bigger than normal because it incorporates a rumble feature that vibrates as you drill though strategically placed blocks and enemies. It may not sound like much fun but it is a blast suitable for kids of any age (that includes you) I received mine quickly from Canada (about 4-5 days I think). As an added bonus the instruction manual is in colour and includes a separate mini comic which gives you some backstory. Enjoy.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 1, 0, 0, 21]]
