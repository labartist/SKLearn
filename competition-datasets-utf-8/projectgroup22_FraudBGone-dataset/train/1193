[5, "Lovely item for a baby that doesn't walk yet. Perfect for rainy day in a baby carrier to keep those little feet dry. Although I got mine mainly for being able to let my free range baby crawl about in a sand and rain when he wasn't walking yet, but unfortunately I got the size large  and it was way too big, so had to return it. But I would rekommend it as it looks like a lovely item.", [4, 5, 9, 22, 79], [1, 1, 1, 5, 56]]
