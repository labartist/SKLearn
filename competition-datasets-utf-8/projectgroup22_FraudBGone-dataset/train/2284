[5, 'We bought these to add some additional lighting to a wall in the garden which is usually quite dark due to the neighbours trees blocking the light. These emit a lovely bright light which shines all across the wall. The great thing about them is the length of the wire that the lights are on.... it is really really long. We have managed to get the lights going up and down the wall as well as wrapping them around a bush we have the garden. There are different modes which add different lighting effects. These look fantastic in the garden', [0, 0, 0, 2, 45], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
