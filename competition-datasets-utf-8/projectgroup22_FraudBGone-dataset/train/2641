[5, 'My son for whom this was bought as a token best man present loived it, as it has a sort of steampunk look to it. The watch is nicely made and looks much better than the photo suggests, (some mifght think it a bit gaudy, but it is rather stylish). A nice accessory which looked really good with the chain that comes with it, although my son was a bit miffed that his waistcoat had the fob pockets sewed shut (why the hell do they do that???), but once his girlfriend applied her trusty scissors, the watch and chain looked really good and complimented his suit quite elegantly. A quality product at a cheap price. Highly recommended.', [5, 1, 9, 18, 69], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
