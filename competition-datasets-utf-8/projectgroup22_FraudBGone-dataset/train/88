[5, "A great film, funny and not lacking in action either. Any film with Samuel L Jackson, Colin Firth and Mark Strong in is likely to be good and this doesn't disappoint. A solid and perfect performance as always by Colin Firth who in my humble opinion is one of the most versatile British actors of this generation. Great film, give it a try and then go and see the new one!", [205, 84, 179, 578, 2148], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
