[5, "Great sound quality, nice light earpieces. It came with ear tips in the three standard sizes in black and clear, and a shirt clip. And a handy little to carry them in. I have two complaints. The volume and play/pause buttons (which have a nice tactile click, and are easy to locate without looking) are on the left line. I'm used to them being on the right side. The wire (which again has a nice feel to it) is difficult to straighten out of the box. Neither of those are big deals. Assuming these last a while I'd probably get them again.", [1, 0, 0, 0, 176], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9]]
