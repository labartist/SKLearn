[3, "Bright silver plating and crystals !!! Not really, it's so bright silver plated that you even can't see small crystals and the lager in centre one is kind of milky shade not really clear crystal so it doesn't go well. I don't know other people but for me it's so hard to use in any other project . So for me it's difficult to use with even silver jewellery as they are so bright that they stand out very odd way. Sorry, but NO FOR ME at all.", [0, 0, 1, 0, 3], [3, 5, 11, 4, 203]]
