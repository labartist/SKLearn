[1, 'This was bought as a neat multi-tool which had captive screw-driver heads as it will be used on a boat.  I should have guessed the quality it would be from the price, and you get what you pay for I suppose.  The torch lens and cap was cross-threaded when it arrived and in trying to correct this I managed to break the very delicate connections to the battery.  The whole thing is very cheaply constructed in inaccurate injection-molded plastic.  I haven\'t used the screwdrivers yet but by the feel of them, there is quite a lot of "give" the the plastic and I\'m not expecting them to stand up to much torque.  I would spend more money and buy a better too if I were you.', [3, 0, 1, 0, 2], [4, 0, 1, 1, 5]]
