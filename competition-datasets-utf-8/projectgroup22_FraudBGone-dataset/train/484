[5, 'We bought this scrap book as replacement for her to stick her photographs in. It really is lovely and my daughter absolutely loves it. The book has a rustic look to it which will really suit the idea of making a keepsake. There is something special about having something physical which you can hold as opposed to a digital song or an image, so this is right down my street. This also came with a free stationery gift set which was a lovely touch.', [2, 0, 1, 1, 24], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
