[5, "I have always been cautious of buying these as you never can tell how bright the BBs are on video clips ect. However I'm happy to say the product is fantastic! I have no regrets buying this product, it fits perfectly tight and straight onto my RIF and the BBs fire out the end bright, on target, and are amazing to watch fling though the air. Highly recommended before you go buying more expensive TM / G&G products. .", [0, 0, 0, 0, 6], [2, 0, 3, 0, 6]]
