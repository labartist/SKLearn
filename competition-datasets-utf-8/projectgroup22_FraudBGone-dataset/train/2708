[5, "Love this radio! My husband bought it for work in the kitchen, where lots of stuff gets spilled, always humid and hot. And He really enjoys the sound of it too. It's great that it works over blue tooth, but also you can plug your phone in. Battery ir rechargeable and it keeps going for a long time, around 12 hours of non stop playing. We used it while camping, and it was great. Didn't get any sand or water in, took the beating from a small child tossing it around and it's still working like new and no scratch on it. Hubby used it in a shower for a fun and he loved it :)", [11, 3, 7, 27, 215], [1, 1, 1, 5, 56]]
