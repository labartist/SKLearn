[5, 'Very nice set of digital scales with a very clear readout that is also (sadly due to erratic diet habits) very accurate. Very well made and they look nice too and they come with a nifty tape measure too. A very good product at a more than reasonable price. Highly recommended!', [63, 12, 23, 98, 567], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
