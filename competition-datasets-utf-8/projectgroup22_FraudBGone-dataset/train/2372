[5, "This is a very clear cable with a very low level of unwanted noise. A great bargain and at the reduced price I got it (On sale) it's a steal. Highly recommended as a replacement cable. works well with all my other electric instruments as well (bass, violin etc) feels like pretty good quality too. Good customer service from the seller as well", [12, 10, 7, 39, 391], [0, 1, 0, 0, 21]]
