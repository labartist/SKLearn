[5, "Brilliant as per usual, if u r not watching the series yet then u r missing out big time. The actors r great and really gel well together all round. The week to week story lines r brilliantly written and will keep u guessing till the end of each and the over riding plot keeps the mystery and intriguing storylines if Sherlocks and Watson's nemises looming dangerously in the background - but for how long we wonder -  I love it so will u , can't wait for the next series.", [0, 1, 3, 21, 138], [10, 4, 7, 21, 153]]
