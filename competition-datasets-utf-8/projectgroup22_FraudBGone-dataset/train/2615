[5, "It works! I tried it for one run and so far really like it. What's great is that it doesn't move. I had a previous running belt that kept moving up and down and drove me nuts. This is just great. Waaaaay better than a stupid arm band that I used before that I couldn't see my phone with. I had to angle my arm a weird way to see it and even then it was hazy as the plastic part covering it was getting grimy. It's a win! Wish it had zippers on some of the pockets. or at least some velcro to close it so that stuff doesn't fly out.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 140], [0, 0, 0, 0, 13]]
