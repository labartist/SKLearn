[5, "Anyone that has watched a blockbuster film or an incredible game and has latterly found that they were humming some of the incidental music, the chances are it will have been written by Two Steps From Hell. Incredible melodies that often send shivers down your spine. Anyone who fancies a taster go to YouTube and watch the official trailer for Mass Effect Three, the track Protectors of Earth is the music and if you like that then you're going to love this album. Once you have listened to this you will get a better idea of the sheer impact that the erroneously termed 'incidental music' has to make a film or a game even better. Two incredible composers!", [0, 1, 2, 12, 114], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
