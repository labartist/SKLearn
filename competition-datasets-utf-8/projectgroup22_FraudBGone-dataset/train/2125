[5, "We replaced it with this grooming brush. It does the job of removing any old hair from their fur and the brush is so simple to clean. The bristles retract and any loose hair simply falls away. It used to be a chore having to clean the dead hair from the old brush but this makes life so much easier. Our dog doesn't move at all when we are brushing him and he seems to enjoy it. This is an excellent brush at a very good price.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
