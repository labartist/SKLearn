[5, 'Another thing I absolutely love about this, when you\'re watching a movie or football match etc there\'s no buffering whatsoever, it\'s crystal clear - my Firestick is ok but the buffering issue is a nightmare so this is a huge plus in my book! - it says it has "4K Ultra-High-Definition watching capability" which I thought was just a sales pitch but you know what?
