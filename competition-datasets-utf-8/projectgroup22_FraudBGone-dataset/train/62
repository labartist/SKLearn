[5, 'I purchased this to replace a much smaller pouch (also Lowepro) which had become simply too small for my expanding photography equipment. I chose this model as it offers a good combination of storage space, portability, comfort and versatility. The lower section is for your camera hardware and has movable Velcro dividers to suit your gear. It has a good zipper design which allows you to either simply unzip at the side and quickly grab your camera whilst still carrying it, or to completely open the section to gain access to more of your gear. I do a lot of walking and there is sufficient space in the upper section to carry food and waterproofs, whilst an outside netted pouch carries my drink. The notebook compartment is well protected and easily takes my laptop, which is useful when away walking to upload my photos. Plenty of other compartments for cables and disks, etc. The two lower clips and straps on the back will easily carry my tripod when required. Comfortable to wear for long walks, but also tough enough to cope with the outdoors. Best of all, I got it from Amazon for \x95Â£25 less than the High Street. If you like taking your gear on outdoor adventures, I would certainly recommend this.', [2, 4, 24, 112, 362], [0, 0, 0, 0, 36]]
