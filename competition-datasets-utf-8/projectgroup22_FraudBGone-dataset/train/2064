[5, "This is possibly the best eye liner I've ever used. It's a felt tip eyeliner which makes it extremely easy to use as you're just drawing it on. There's so much control and this is perfect for a beginner or a pro. The colour is nice and dark with a matte finish, it's not waterproof but doesn't rub off easily. I've only used it a few times but it's by far the best eyeliner I've used. Amazing price, will definitely recommend and buy again.", [1, 0, 2, 1, 4], [3, 0, 4, 15, 33]]
