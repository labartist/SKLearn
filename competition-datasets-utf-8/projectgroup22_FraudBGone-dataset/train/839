[5, "This is an amendment to a comment I left a couple weeks ago saying I hadn't used these headphones yet. I love these headphones!! Used them in the gym all week. Doing both upper body and lower body exercises, they worked great!! I looked around at other people using wired and wireless, and even with the wires from my other headphones run up under my shirt, with the controls to my music on the airbud it made these Antimi Bluetooth was so convenient! I would get these again if anything happened to mine!", [0, 0, 0, 0, 834], [0, 0, 0, 0, 10]]
