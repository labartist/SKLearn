[5, 'I\'ve had an Animal wallet previously for the last few years - it\'s testament is that my previous one lasted so long - 7 years I think.  It was largely white and regularly went through the wash, each time regaining its "new" colour.  Eventually the zip went and in looking for its replacement it was only Animal that I considered - I\'ve had fabric wallets previously (NOT Animal) where the zip went after months, not years.  My new wallet is identical in layout and design to my old one apart from the design of the fabric.  I haven\'t yet had to wash this one, but there\'s no reason to think it won\'t wash as well as my old one. I\'m looking forward to another few years with my new wallet.  BTW, why is it described as a "mens" wallet?  Surely this design appeals to both - I\'m a girl.', [0, 0, 0, 1, 4], [4, 0, 1, 1, 5]]
