[5, "This newly expanded version of Raymond Willaims' original addresses a host of newly important keywords in addition to the previous selection, and does so with insight, elan, and relevance.  It is an interesting read, even if you're not in need of the sources and shades of meanings of the words included.  Among my favorites for words that have been pivotol in discussions of culture and society, are aesthetics, art, ideology, civilization, conservatism, liberalism, education, family, fundamentalism, justice, multiculturalism, objectivity, pragmatism, race, relativism, theory, science, pragmatism, gender, race, and value--just a sample of words needed to discuss issues with deeper understanding than a dictionary provides--even some technical dictionaries.  And the discussion is benefitted from the expansion of contributors and the consistency across entries.  The entries on aesthetics and pragamtism are particular notable.", [1, 0, 1, 1, 1], [8, 7, 25, 16, 59]]
