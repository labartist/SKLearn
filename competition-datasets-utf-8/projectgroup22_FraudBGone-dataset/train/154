[5, "I'm amazed at the great quality of these torches considering the cost, they feel well made, you get batteries included too which is rare these days, there's 3 different light modes: full beam, dim beam and flashing light, easy to control, brilliant light coming from one single battery too so very well designed! - there's a clip attached for keeping them in your pocket for convenience, I can't recommend these super little torches enough, when we go camping in our motorhome they are going to be very useful, so handy to have around the home too and I'm more than happy with my purchase!", [0, 0, 0, 2, 42], [1, 0, 0, 1, 158]]
