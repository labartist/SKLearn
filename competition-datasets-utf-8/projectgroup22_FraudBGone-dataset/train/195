[5, "Now I have this watch my old one will be put to one side, it still works ok but this new Comtex one is in a different league to be honest, it will be on my wrist virtually all the time! - it even looks and feels like good quality, it's quite weighty but not too much to be uncomfortable, I'm also impressed with the price, I have looked at good quality watches for a while now and I doubt if there's a better quality watch out there at this price tag - it's very impressive and it gets a 5 star rating without any hesitation! *****", [0, 0, 0, 0, 5], [1, 0, 0, 1, 158]]
