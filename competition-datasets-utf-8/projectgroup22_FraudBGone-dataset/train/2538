[5, "Great cable! I've tried a few third party Lightning cables and this is a good one. Clearly better than the ones I got from ebay. It functions perfectly. Now that we've gotten to the point where cables have chips embedded in them, cables are not just wire, they are actually devices. These are good devices and function exactly as the original Apple one does with my iPhone 5. I've now bought a few of them so I can have one in my car, one for my overnight charger, and one to carry around in my backpack.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 116], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]]
