[5, "My cat loves this - never out of it - it's her own little den where she can hide away for 18 hours a day! Good quality, decent size and machine washable.  I've had this about 6 months now and wash it every month.  Just take out the cushion, wash it, then hang it all on the line and it pops back into shape and is dry in no time!", [1, 1, 1, 2, 9], [2, 1, 2, 5, 21]]
