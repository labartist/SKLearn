[5, 'We often go camping either for weekends away or on holiday. For us, space is often limited, you can only carry so much back and forth with you so we are always looking to try and save space. This folding wash basin has been perfect for us. Its strong, seems very durable and is waterproof. When fully extended into a basin its very sturdy and strong enough to fill.
