[5, "Without doubt these are the best kitchen knives I've used. As cooking is my hobby it's essential to have a knife that's sharp and importantly stays sharp for slicing, chopping and  dicing. This little gem although lighter than its big brother chefs knife, will do much of the work that the larger eight inch and heavier blade will do. If you're going to buy a set of knives then these will serve you well and still be sharp long after a cheaper version. Top quality and worth the money.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
