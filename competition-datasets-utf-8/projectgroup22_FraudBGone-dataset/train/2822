[5, "Superb little tablet, in pristine condition considering it was a pre-owned unit. As a network engineer I'm usually fairly picky, but the Acer Iconic meets and exceeds all if my expectations. A brilliant tablet for the price and well worth considering as a first buy. Brand new they're about \x95Â£200, but gems like the one I bought appear fairly regularly so keep an eye out for a bargain. Very pleased indeed.", [8, 2, 1, 9, 34], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
