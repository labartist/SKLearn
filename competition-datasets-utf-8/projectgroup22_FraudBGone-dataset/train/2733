[5, "I have never used anything that works as well as this does. I carry my inhaler, I'd, and galaxy S4 on this with no issues. I have used it on longer runs 8 miles and still no issue. I do have to say that you definitely want to check the sizing on their actual website and think about where you want to wear it.
