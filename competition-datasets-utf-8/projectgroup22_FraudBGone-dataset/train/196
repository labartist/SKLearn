[5, "My wife bought me this recently along with some beard oil and I have to say I love it. I used to shape my beard using a razor and a lot of guess work, quite often I would end up with uneven lines or one side a different length to the other. This has made life far easier and has taken out all of the guess work. I have used it a couple of times so far and I have to say that I am very pleased with the results. My neckline is far neater since I started using this shaping tool, in fact I've actually started to use this every other day.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
