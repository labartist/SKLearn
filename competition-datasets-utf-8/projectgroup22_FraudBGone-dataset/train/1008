[5, "This is a lovely set of solar string lights which we have used to add some extra lighting in our garden. Each light is a solid plastic ball which emits a lovely bright and warm glow. There is an on/off switch on the back of the little solar panel plus a mode button where you can select different lighting modes. Since we have had these we haven't had any problems with them and the light seems to last all night as they have still been glowing when we have got up the next morning.", [1, 0, 0, 2, 38], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
