[5, "These earbuds sounded fantastic right out of the box, with no burn-in needed. I listened to a variety of styles to assess the sound quality: hip-hop, deep house, death metal, indie rock, classical, electronica, ambient/drone, and others. The bass response is impressive: very full but generally well-defined and not overpowering. On bass-heavy music (like house, dub, and techno) the bass can be a little strong, but a quick EQ tweak is an easy fix. The highs are crisp and clear, without any harshness or sibilance. The mids are good, but could maybe use a tiny bump. Overall, a solid 9/10 for sound quality. They're quite light, but they feel solidly built. The link between the earbuds and cables is heavily reinforced and feels quite strong. I'm not worried about a wire popping out if I accidentally tug a little too hard. The cable is standard rubbery plastic, but it doesn't feel cheap, and it seems to be fairly tangle-proof, which is a huge plus for me, since tangled/warped earbud cables are a pet peeve of mine. These are impressive little earbuds, especially considering the price. They stack up excellently versus earbuds that are nearly twice the price such as the SoundMagic E10s and Sennheiser CX300s. These have a bit of an edge on the SoundMagic E10s, and are at least equal to the Sennheiser CX300s. I doubt you'll be disappointed with these earbuds, especially considering the remarkably low cost.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 90], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9]]
