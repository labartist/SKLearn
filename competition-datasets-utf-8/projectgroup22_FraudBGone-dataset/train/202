[3, "This seemed to be just the ticket but the mobile phone didn't fit snugly -- it kept popping out of the new plastic shell. Somehow I managed to damage the green plastic so no chance of returning it for a refund, but since it was under a fiver so no real financial damage done. It's a pity the thing didn't fit properly -- I need to protect my phone. I suggest that if you buy one be very careful with it when you try to fit your phone, just in case you do decide to return it.", [23, 9, 17, 32, 150], [0, 1, 8, 24, 26]]
