[5, 'This review is based on the actions of the seller zOverstocks rather than a console that has proven ability. The original unit had a faulty GPU but after contact the supplier has agreed to replace the faulty one. Polite and efficient handling which is why Zoverstocks rather than the console get the five stars, the PS3 is a great console but it has a couple of issues as they get older so even a tested unit can take it into its silicon head to fail without a lot of warning.  Hopefully the replacement will be OK.', [26, 4, 17, 23, 153], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
