[5, "This belt is a blessing and a curse. Working 12 hour shifts as a nurse gets very uncomfortable by the end of the night, and I was walking around holding my pregnant belly. This belt feels so nice and supportive so I don't feel like I have to hold up my belly anymore, BUT at the same time the belt itself starts to feel uncomfortable after an entire shift of sitting and walking around. It makes it difficult to go to the bathroom and I find myself constantly readjusting it. I definitely won't go to work without it, but I need to figure out when to put it on or take it off during the shift because wearing it for 12 hours is too much.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 139], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9]]
