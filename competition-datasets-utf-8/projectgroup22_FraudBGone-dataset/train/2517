[5, "This is a strong solid bike lock which is definitely worth the price. We bought this to lock our bikes up outside our static caravan. The long length of the cable means we can lock all of the bikes up at once, where previously we needed 2 bike locks. The lock itself is really strong and robust. It's made from good solid material which gives us extra peace of mind that our bikes are safe from being stolen", [2, 0, 0, 0, 17], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
