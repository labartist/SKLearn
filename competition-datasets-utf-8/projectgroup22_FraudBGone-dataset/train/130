[5, "Put my old lights up which had been working well for several years, not bothering to check them first, which of course meant half the set weren't working. Needed a long or connectable set but not that many long sets out there. Found these and ordered, delivered next day and they are great. Perfect length (17 metres of lights) long cable to plug, various flashing patterns and a built-in timer and remote control, and very bright. A good purchase and would certainly recommend.", [40, 22, 37, 57, 289], [0, 0, 0, 0, 36]]
