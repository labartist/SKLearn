[5, "I love this! I was a little confused at first with how to put this product in my ear, but I like it better than my previous Bluetooth headset. It fits in your ear without blocking hardly any ambient noise from entering your ear, while still not going to fall out. I will use this to make long calls and then switch over to watching videos or playing music. The sound quality is great, even for music. Very quick to connect and buttons are easily accessible after you learn where they are. The mic is great too. People say they can understand me better than when I am on my phone. I like that it uses a standard charging cable too because I already have a bunch of them. Overall, very happy and can't believe how cheap it is selling for!", [0, 0, 0, 1, 169], [0, 0, 0, 0, 13]]
