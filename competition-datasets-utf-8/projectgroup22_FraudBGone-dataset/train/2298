[5, "A fairly good quality product that actually doesn't fit on the Smart ForFour very well. Very fiddly and in my instance the cross member bolts were missing, but huge credit to Fastcar for getting replacements out asap! For those with a Smart ForFour, you will find it a tiresome job to get the angles perfect so that it doesn't slip off with the slightest amount of weight on it, but perseverance will see it fitted well enough to transport a double mattress ok. Do take it off when you've finished with it or it'll play havoc with your mpg!", [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
