[5, 'This is a great set of locks, especially for the price. My niece asked me to get her a lock so that she could take her bike to school and chain it up in the school shed. I came across this pack of 4 which also come with an added cable that can be used with the locks which I thought would be perfect for her bike. A set of instruction is included for setting the combination. The instructions were simple to follow and setting the combination was dead easy. The locks themselves feel strong and secure. I will use the rest to replace the aging locks on our shed.', [0, 1, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
