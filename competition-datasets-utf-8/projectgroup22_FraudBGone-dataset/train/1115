[5, 'A great quality hosepipe which expands and retracts so doesnt take up as much storage space as my old one. The brass connections are a great addition and a big improvement on the cheaper plastic type. This comes with a neat little nozzle with 8 different spray settings and a neat little storage bag. The connections fit firmly in place with no leaks. All in all a great upgrade to my old hosepipe.', [0, 0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
