[4, "We have 3 Yorkshire Terriers in our family and although they are only small dogs it does take some time to cut their hair, especially when they need their summer cut. We have tried using other clippers, even normal hair clippers and while the results have been OK one of the dogs in particular really does not like the noise. These are really quiet and so far the dogs haven't minded them at all. The only minor gripe is that the plug is a two pronged European one, but for us this was no big thing as we already had an adaptor, and you can get them from as little as ¥£1 anyway. Aside from that this is a fantastic set with lots of accessories including scissors, nail clippers and a file. I am really pleased with this grooming kit, especially for the price.", [0, 0, 0, 5, 8], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
