[5, "This is a great blender - had it 4 months, used nearly every day, has no problem crushing frozen fruit, and deals well with thicker foodstuffs like honey or peanut butter. Comes apart easily for cleaning. I'd recommend drying the blade after washing, mine started to show signs of rust when I was leaving it to air dry. Highly recommended appliance!", [2, 1, 0, 2, 10], [2, 2, 2, 2, 16]]
