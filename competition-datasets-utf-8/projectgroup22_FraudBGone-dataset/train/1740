[3, "Ordered this item based on other positive reviews, certainly it is easy to use and holds a lot of laundry. The first one arrived and was broken (one of the horizontal arms had come out of its plastic hinge). The company replaced the item for me free of charge, but the replacement has just developed the same problem. Can't be bothered sending it off for a replacement so have glued it. Not ideal, considering the price of this item, but it works.", [31, 13, 20, 20, 65], [2, 2, 2, 2, 16]]
