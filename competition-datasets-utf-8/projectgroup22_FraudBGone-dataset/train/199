[5, "I went on the search for some clippers which weren't as loud and these seem to have done the trick. He was still a bit cautious at first but he soon got used to them. My initial thought was that these are really light. They have a nice professional look feel to them and they cut through his fur really well. He spends a lot of time in the garden so his fur gets all matted up, especially underneath, but these clippers cut through it nice and cleanly and with ease. They come with a nice range of attachments and guards, even a spare blade. There is a safety guard, which can be seen on the picture (the white bit below the blade) which stops you from catching your pets skin. All in all this is a great set.", [2, 0, 1, 0, 36], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
