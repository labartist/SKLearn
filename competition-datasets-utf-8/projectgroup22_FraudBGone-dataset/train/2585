[5, "First of all I will say that I totally love dupstep and I totally love metal/nu metal music. I think both genres have been around long enought that someone should have given a crossover a try. Korn and friends are the first I have heard of that have stepped over the line into this dup-metal sound. My review is 5 stars because the sound that they have made is totally on point and I cant wait for more bands and DJ's to join forces to make more music like this!!!", [1, 2, 4, 15, 37], [3, 1, 0, 4, 38]]
