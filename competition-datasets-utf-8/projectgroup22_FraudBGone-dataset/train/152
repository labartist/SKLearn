[5, "I was looking for a device to use for writing whilst on the go, so mainly for word processing and internet research, nothing heavy duty. I have been using this machine for a few weeks now and I love it. It is a solid little unit with everything I need and more, and the versatility to easily detach the tablet/screen from the keyboard is great. Full Windows 10 OS is good, and the slimmed down version of Word it comes with is adequate, although I have installed the full version due to the nature of my work. I particularly like the full size keys which have a solid feel to them when depressed. Various sockets enable every connectivity, good battery life. For the price, you're getting a lot of machine and with this one you can't go far wrong.", [12, 12, 14, 24, 76], [0, 0, 0, 0, 36]]
