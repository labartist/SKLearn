[5, 'The design of the bowl means that the dog cannot simply take big mouthfuls of the food all at once. Instead the maze type effect means that the dog has to eat smaller portions. Sometimes food gets stuck in the corners and he has to manoeuvre it out with his tongue instead. Since we got the bowl it has really slowed our dog down and there is no more running away with belly ache. This really does the trick and we seem to have a much happier dog since we introduced the slow feeder bowl.', [0, 0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
