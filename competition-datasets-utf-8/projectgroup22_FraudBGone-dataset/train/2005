[1, "For starters I have to say my internet is fabulous when I plug in an Ethernet cable I can reach over 100mbps download speed and over 52 up. This piece of s*** console has a max speed of 117.0kbps down and 12.1kbps up. That is when it actually connects to anything. The wireless adapter in these consoles is ridiculously s***. It's just not worth it at all. I swapped it for an Xbox One thinking it'd be better. I normally play games on the PC and never have a problem in fact my PC is further away from the router than my PS4 and wirelessly I can reach over 60mbps download speeds. The worst thing I've experienced with the PlayStation is its constant updates and the hours and hours it takes to download them when I can actually connect the s***** thing to the internet. If you're planning on buying one of these to play your s***** CoD games or Fifa I highly recommend buying them for the PC. If you must have a console however buy something actually reliable like a SNes or a Sega Megadrive.", [221, 53, 94, 189, 1370], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]]
