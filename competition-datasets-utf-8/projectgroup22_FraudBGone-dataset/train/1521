[5, 'An excellent series,with plenty of intrigue, sex and great acting. A different take on the original tale, but all.for the better in my opinion. For example Merlin is a much younger man ( although still many decades old ) and you are left wondering if he has alternative motives for helping the young handsome Arther. There is no sign yet of a second series, but I really hope there will be especially as I have already begun to recommend the series to my family and friends. So come on Amazon SECOND SERIES PLEASE. .', [0, 1, 2, 1, 7], [10, 4, 7, 21, 153]]
