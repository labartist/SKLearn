[4, "A comprehensive study of the battle that ended the war.  Very frank about the failures of American generals and the lack of preparation of American soldiers.  Parts that describe the locations of this or that group can get pretty dulling of the brain.  It doesn't help that there are only a few maps and that many of the locations mentioned are not on the few maps that are provided. But there's plenty of material about individual soldiers' experiences. The book, however, is decidedly one-sided with little in the way of detail about German forces or individuals.", [0, 0, 1, 2, 2], [8, 7, 25, 16, 59]]
