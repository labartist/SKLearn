[5, "I ordered these for my friend as Thanksgiving gift, because she is a Airbnb host and I heard she complaint about her solar lights once. this review is from her:These work awesome! I was so apprehensive about these because they are great and they charge during day light and stay lighted through the night. The light itself gives out beautiful color. These are more of a decorative light, which is fine to me, because it does just what I need it to do _\x86_ add color to my yard and look pretty with my flowers. I like solar lights much better than the electric lights I did have in my garden and took the old ones out to replace them with these. I'm so pleased with these I'm thinking of ordering a few more for our patio.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 168], [0, 0, 0, 0, 13]]
