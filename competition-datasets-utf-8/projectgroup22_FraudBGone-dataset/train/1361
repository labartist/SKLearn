[5, "Pros - It does everything a fitbit can do. - You do not have to charge it!!!!!!!!!! That's my favorite part, it lasts a year and the battery is cheap and easy to replace. - The App is nice. - It's cheaper. Cons - You can not see the screen in the dark. Moonlight/Street light works, or any feint light is enough to see what is on the screen. (No, There is not a back-light for this one.) This does not bother me at all. I imagine it would bother some people, that is why i mentioned it. You can just get the second Vivofit, it has a back light. I would give that one no cons!", [0, 0, 0, 0, 165], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7]]
