[4, "The TV is of really high standard and I did not expect the product to perform at such a high level. The only little thing which would have given the 5 star is that there is a little sticker that's attached to the top left of the TV and it's impossible to remove without the glue and some remains of the sticker left on the TV which makes it look a bit untidy but overall it's a great TV and I would recommend it to anyone. Great work guys :)", [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 4, 7]]
