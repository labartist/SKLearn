[5, "I'd previously worn a Fitbit Flex for a little over a year and while not totally displeased with it, I was getting tired of having to charge it every week or so. I also did not like how it was able to be manipulated by shaking it on my wrist and having to rely on the app to see how many steps were tracked. My wife enjoyed her VivoFit so I decided to invest in one as well since the price was reasonable. Pro: Sturdy, seems more immune to manipulation from wear, battery life, display, color, watch/time feature, slate color is a TRUE Slate color (no blue tint to it.) Con: (Sometimes) Difficult to Sync to iPhone, no lights/backlight feature, app/connect program is a bit overwhelming and I consider myself technologically savvy. At the end of the day I'm extremely pleased with this choose and continue to recommend and prefer it to the Fitbit Flex. (Said Fitbit now resides in the kitchen junk drawer.)", [0, 0, 0, 0, 165], [0, 0, 0, 0, 11]]
