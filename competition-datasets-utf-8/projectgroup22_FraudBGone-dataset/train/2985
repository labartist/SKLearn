[5, "I also like that these cables don't twist or tangle like most, they keep reasonably rigid and straight, a lot i've had were a pain, I was forever twisting and turning them to untangle the mess that they were in, not with these beauties! :) They are slightly thicker than most too, which gives you the distinct impression that a lot of thought has gone into designing and manufacturing this product, I really like it when a company thinks about the consumer and comes up with a great quality item at a very good price - I'm very impressed and have no hesitation in highly recommending them to everyone, if you purchase these cables you will not be disappointed!", [5, 1, 0, 7, 70], [1, 0, 0, 1, 158]]
