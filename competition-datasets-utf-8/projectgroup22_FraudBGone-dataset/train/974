[5, 'I got this workout belt after I recently upgraded to an I phone 6 and my old workout belt wasn\'t large enough to hold it. It has been working out (pun intended) GREAT! It is a large improvement over my previous workout belt which had a plastic buckle and adjustable elastic straps. I love that this belt is all cloth and has not plastic parts that can dig into you while you\'re exercising. I got the medium size (I thinks my hips are about 34" and waist around 28") and it fits around my hips and waist comfortably. I securely holds my phone while I exercise and isn\'t so loose that it moves around at all. I would highly recommend this product!', [0, 0, 0, 0, 140], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5]]
