[5, 'I have about 10-11 of bread baking tin,but this one has arrived today and I have decided to use it today and I tell people this one is fantastic,amazing and superb. My previous bake tin was not high enough to rise and cook perfect as they all have 3" height so when I bake a bread it cooks perfect,but because of quite lot to rise and not enough height of loaf tin it goes out from side,so it\'s wider from top and little narrow from height of loaf tin. But this is so perfect that I don\'t have a word to express,so this one is 110% perfect and if you are really looking for perfect loaf then this loaf tin is what you are looking for. Must buy !!!!!', [5, 4, 3, 16, 124], [3, 5, 11, 4, 203]]
