[5, "I just got these things after looking to order other brands. I am very happy that I ordered these instead, they are great quality for the price! They fit nicely and are not uncomfortable, as I find most ear buds to be. The sound quality is pretty good, and they are easy to pair and use. They also come with extra ear buds, two charge chords, a D.C. adapter, and a cool little carrying case. Definitely satisfied and would recommend to anyone looking for some Bluetooth earphones. I can't wait to take them snowboarding! Update: I like them so much I just ordered another pair!", [0, 0, 0, 0, 97], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9]]
