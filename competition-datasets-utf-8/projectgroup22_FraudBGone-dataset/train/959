[5, "I bought refurb product and and I'm in love with it. Very simple and very effective product to motivate you to keep moving. No rechargeable batteries mean you can wear it like your traditional watches. Just replace batteries every year(Costs about $5 DIY). Water resistant/proof: countless hours in swimming/shower and no water damage so far. I haven't taken it off in weeks.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 145], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8]]
