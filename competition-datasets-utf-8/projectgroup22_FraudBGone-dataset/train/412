[5, "User friendly, very strong if you follow the instructions and use them on smooth surfaces. They're especially good on ceramic tiles in the kitchen and bathroom, but I would caution the buyer to keep them away from high volumes of water vapour from cooking, or too near to a boiling kettle. They can be used multiple times with the relatively inexpensive replacement strips so are very good value for money. As an engineer of forty years experience in heavy fabrication and latterly electronics, I can say with reasonable assuredness that these little gems will offer great service and will easily support the weight that the manufacturer claims, but it is essential that care to place these on a smooth medium, i.e. not brick and not wallpaper and you will not be disappointed. Highly recommended.", [15, 4, 14, 37, 164], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
