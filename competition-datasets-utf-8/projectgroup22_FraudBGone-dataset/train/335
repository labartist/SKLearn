[5, "Great sound quality and good (not great) Bluetooth range but overall a awesome item, especially for the price point. I would say they're comparable to a pair of wireless Beats I owned before they crapped out on me. I'd definitely recommend the product to others. Especially for gym goers who don't wanna kill themselves fumbling with the old fashioned wired headphones of yesteryear.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 103], [0, 0, 0, 0, 12]]
