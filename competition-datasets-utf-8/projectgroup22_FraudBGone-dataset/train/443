[5, "Bought as part of my wife's Lisa Parker collection. A lovely mug, with a beautiful graphic of a cat that I'd swear was my beloved black moggie Sammy, which is nice as it's a reminder of a much loved friend. The mug is of the usual high quality, but needs to be treated with respect when washing as we lost the handle on one and a plate slid a half inch and tapped a second that sheared the base off. As ours are predominantly for display as a collection we could invisibly repair them, but do be warned they can be a bit fragile.", [1, 3, 1, 9, 64], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
