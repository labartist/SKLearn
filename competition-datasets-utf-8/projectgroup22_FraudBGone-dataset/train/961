[5, 'This was an awesome way to carry ID and cash at a 3 day outdoor concert. I was worried things would slip out or shift because the slots you insert the cards/cash into are open, but perhaps because the belt fit appropriately snug, everything stayed put for the most part - very small shift maybe but nothing fell out. In fact sometimes I had to work a bit at getting cash out lol Very comfortable and not bulky / annoying. It did get warm one day when it was 90 degrees but that was 9 hours of standing in the sun so not surprising any kind of belt would get warm.', [0, 0, 0, 0, 140], [0, 0, 0, 0, 10]]
