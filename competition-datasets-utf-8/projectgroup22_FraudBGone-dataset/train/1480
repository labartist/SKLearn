[5, "Wasn't sure about using this but it's brilliant! Took a bit longer to microwave than it said on the instructions but it stayed hot for longer than I expected.. Got the hang of it after 10 minutes, easiest to use in small blobs at a time when it is very hot!!  Love the results and the price is amazing - think I'll stick to this rather than spending a fortune at the salon!!", [28, 18, 29, 52, 100], [1, 2, 0, 1, 3]]
