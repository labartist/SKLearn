[4, "I've been using this to play music on my phone through my surround sound amplifier and also to transfer music to the aux in my car. So far I havent had any problems with this at all. The sound transfers OK and the quality is excellent. I havent experienced any background interference or humming. The cable is braided which gives it added strength and should prevent it from bending or breaking easily All in all a great little cable that transfers music perfectly.", [0, 0, 1, 1, 5], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
