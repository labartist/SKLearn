[5, "I've been using these headphones every day for about 3 months now, and they've proved to be well worth their money so far. PROS: - Long lasting battery - Good Sound Quality - Bluetooth range is about 30ft.+ - Sync is easy - Easy to Use - Doesn't tangle CONS: - Takes very long to fully charge (over an hour)e - Will lose its charge overnight (even if it is off) - Will sometimes fall out of your ears I do not use these headphones for running, so they may fall out of your ears more often if that's what you're using them for, which could be more frustrating. If you're using them for weightlifting or just casually, then these headphones will suit you well.", [0, 0, 0, 0, 80], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9]]
