[5, 'Purchased in order to carry a rather bulky cordless phone around with me on site, rather than in my pocket. Perfect size with a velcro flap, also smaller compartments for pens/pencils/screwdriver,etc. and a loop for other tools and a spring clip for things such as keys. Good strong metal clip to attach over belt enabling it to be attached and removed without removing my belt. Good robust material and construction. would certainly recommend.', [0, 0, 2, 1, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 36]]
