[4, "Very fast delivery! I'm impressed at how fast it arrived. Ordered on Sunday night and Monday morning it was there. The ring itself is lovely. Much thinner than I thought it'd be. The gold looks genuine and shiny. I hope it doesn't fade. Over all, quite a nice present for my mum who wanted a pretty little gold ring. Great price.", [1, 1, 2, 3, 8], [3, 0, 4, 15, 33]]
