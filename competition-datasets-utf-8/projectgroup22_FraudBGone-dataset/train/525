[5, "It's so nice to receive something that really does what it's supposed to do and does it well. Far too often tech has some flaw or another but these do exactly what they say they will. The bluetooth hooks up nicely, they charge quickly, they sound great. The supplied ear buds were too small for me but they come with another two sizes so a quick change and even that potential fly in the ointment was rectified. Overall, very pleased with these. They've restored my faith in tech.", [1, 0, 2, 0, 5], [12, 4, 3, 5, 15]]
