[5, "My little wee man loves this toy. I got it a good while ago, but only now he's developing capabilities of understanding it and making sense how it works. The toy is well made, no sharp edges,  colour is not fading and the paint is not chipping. Overall, very good classic wooden toy that has less impact on the invironment.", [13, 9, 24, 45, 157], [1, 1, 1, 5, 56]]
