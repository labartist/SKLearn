[3, 'This book is mainly for professional (and free-lance) copy editors, and it explains in some detail, and with some humor, some of the common work-related issues facing such professionals.  There is a chapter for authors but, for the most part, I didn\'t find it to be terribly useful. The chapter about word processing had a few useful ideas, but it didn\'t really enlighten me to any great extent. As an editor of a scholarly journal and as a teacher of graduate writing courses for neophyte scholars, I had hoped the book might have been of more use to me (e.g., in copy editing authors\' and students\' manuscripts), particuarly as regards the Chicago Style Manual.  I did learn a few things, but not as much as I had hoped. One insight, though, was particularly interesting: the author\'s approach is that copy editing does not have mainly in mind protecting the publisher, the scholarly field, or even the author but of addressing the audience\'s need for clarity, accuracy, and consistency.  That focus and a certain pragmatism--taking into serious consideration individual circumstances and particulars, as opposed to a slavish following of rules--seem to be the "subversive" of the title.  The book is well-written, short, an easy read, and inexpensive; so it might be worth looking into.  But it really is not a \'how to\' book and anyone wanting that kind of information should look for other titles that cover copy editing techniques, skills, etc., in more detail.', [0, 0, 1, 0, 2], [8, 7, 25, 16, 59]]
