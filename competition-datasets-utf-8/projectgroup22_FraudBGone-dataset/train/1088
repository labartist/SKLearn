[2, "This worked once and refuses to work any more. The steam tank works but the trigger refuses to function. No response from the manufacturer when reported. I'd advise anyone looking for a steam cleaner to spend a bit more and buy a Karcher. The knowledge that you'll not only have a unit that will work repeatedly, but also a manufacturer that will respond to enquiries. This would only get one star apart from the fact that the boiler is very good.", [24, 7, 9, 22, 22], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
