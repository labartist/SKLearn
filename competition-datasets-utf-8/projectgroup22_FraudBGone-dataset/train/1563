[5, 'Always a big fan of the anthems, I bought outrospective, Reverence and Saturday night/Sunday morning. Desperate for more I bought this, To All New Arrivals and The Dance. The Dance came first and I  immediately loved it, especially Sun to Me. Then I bought the last 2 and I actually think they are my all time favourites. Both albums flow really well from start to finish, with up beat dance tunes alongside lovely soulful melodies. These, in my opinion are their best albums so far. I want more!!', [0, 0, 1, 12, 12], [3, 2, 2, 0, 8]]
