[3, 'I actually really like this.very small journal,but only because I knew exactly the size it would be when it arrived. I measured it out on a ruler. What I did not expect was the very good quality the  paper would be to write on and that I would be able to write on both sides. It arrived promptly too, It is ishowever very expensive for what it is,my opinion is that they they. would sell much more of this product if the price was lowered significantly, to around \x95£5/\x95£6 including postage. Which is why I scored it only 3. I like the product but is really not worth \x95£10.99, even with free postage.', [8, 7, 16, 19, 56], [10, 4, 7, 21, 153]]
