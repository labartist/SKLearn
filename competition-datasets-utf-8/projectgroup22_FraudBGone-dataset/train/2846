[5, 'I came across these slow feeder bowls and decided to give it a try. All I can say is that it really does work. The benefits were immediate. The design of the bowl prevents him from gulping the food and really does slow him down. I was a bit hesitant when it first arrived as the bowl is quite big and looked like it had been designed for a larger dog, it looked far too big for a yorkie. I was pleasantly surprised that it still does its job very effectively and the problematic dog is now the last to end up finishing his meal. Since using this the dog hasnt shown any signs of belly ache or discomfort. I honestly cannot recommend these any more, its a genius idea that really does solve a problem.', [3, 1, 1, 4, 61], [0, 0, 2, 16, 133]]
