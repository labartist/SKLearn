[5, 'Read the other reviews saying this and ignored as I already had a pair of Asics in my normal size 40 (6.5). Needless to say, I had to send them back and get 41.5 (7.5) which fit exactly like my old 40.5 ones. Once you get the sizing right, they are fantastic running shoes. Very happy and will order another pair.', [5, 4, 11, 19, 62], [3, 2, 2, 0, 8]]
