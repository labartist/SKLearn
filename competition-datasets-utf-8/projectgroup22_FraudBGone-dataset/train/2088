[5, "This was bought to use with my pedestal drill-press and I have to say I'm impressed. It is quite small, but then I only want it for very light work and for that it is ideal. The operation is smooth and the finish is excellent for the price. I have a proper modellers CNC milling machine as well but this works for very light jobs when that one is set up and working to do smaller job. If you use it with a drill press, do be aware that you'll need to fix the drilling table to stop it from skewing around. A couple of 12mm studs did the trick for me and as such gave me access to a second and very versatile milling attachment. Highly recommended", [0, 0, 1, 1, 5], [10, 7, 19, 35, 319]]
